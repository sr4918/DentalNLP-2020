In treating patients, I will learn about the community around me so that I can be culturally sensitive and empathetic. I will also stick to a code of ethics that I will hold myself to. These will include putting my patient's desires, and health and oral health above my own personal desires. I will always provide my patients with all their options so that they may be able to make the best decision for their oral health based on their limitations and their understanding. I will always document my procedures and any important events that occur during my patient's visit, so that I can legally protect myself and themselves, and so that the work is documented for future review. I will  never discriminate and will serve all equally, regardless of ethnicity, gender, faith, sexual orientation, etc., taking into consideration the various cultures and beliefs of my patients and being sensitive and understanding of them.",D3L
8,Q3KOrarY,Private Personal,03-06-16 22:55,22.91666667,"As a dental student, I will strive to learn about various oral health diseases and their symptoms, as well as different methods to improve oral hygiene. I will also learn the processes behind these diseases, and how to treat them. In the clinic, I will learn about the characteristics of each teeth, how to restore them via crowns, fillings, or root canals, how to remove caries, how to make complete and partial dentures and how to create models and impressions for studying a patient's mouth or for preparing crowns or retainers. I will also learn how to interact with patients in terms of explaining procedures to them in words they can understand, in a manner that is respectful, and in a empathetic and ethical way (putting the patient's health and wants above my own personal desires). Finally, I hope to learn from my colleagues and practice communicating and working together with them, while helping them in return.

However I will not limit myself to these specialties and I will explore other areas of specialty. I will also be satisfied with being a general dentist as well. Ultimately though, it depends on what I find I enjoy the most. I would also like to open my own clinic or at least have a clinic with another associate, especially because of the ease of accessibility to another dentist's opinion. Finally, I will strive to treat all my patients with respect, and all my colleagues with gratification and respect. I will try to be patient with patients that can be difficult to communicate with or patients who may have different ideologies than myself. I will make sure I am aware of various cultural beliefs and be sensitive to those and at the same time, be mindful that we are made up of a multitude of identities.",D3L

That includes continuing my education by going to conventions and conferences to learn about the most up to date technologies for oral hygiene. I will also constantly challenge myself to better my work, by self-assessing myself often and checking on past work to see if anything should be redone. As a professional, I will strive for clear and concise communication with the patient and with my colleagues. I will also attempt to ensure that all my patients understand the importance of oral hygiene to overall health and the various ways they can take care of their teeth and health.

I've learned how to work with another student as a dental assistant and vice versa, learning more about team effort. I've learned the steps and processes needed in creating a complete and a removable partial denture. I've learned how to prepare crowns and bridges as well as make temporary crowns and bridges. I've learned more about how to interact with patients and now that I am in clinic, I am starting to understand how to communicate with my patients in a way that shows professionalism and competence while still being a student at the school. In the clinic I've been able to practice the above on all my patients, as well as how to give local anesthesia to my patients in the form of nerve blocks and infiltrations, comprehensive exams and x-rays, prophylaxis, scaling and root planing and restorations.

I will learn to treat patients both in the short-term and long-term capacity. I will also strive to treat all my patients with respect, sympathy, and ethically, taking into account their various cultural identities and being sensitive and understanding of them. I will always put the patient's health and desires above any personal gain, and I will be sure to refer my patient's to other doctors or dentists if I do not feel able to complete a procedure.

I believe that as a healthcare professional, we have a duty to provide our patients with the most effective treatment and when we know we are not the right person for our patient to not hesitate and relay our patient to the right person. 

While in dental school I want to always put forth an honest effort in my work and not take any shortcuts because I want to make sure I really understand what is being taught as my future patients deserve that kind of honest effort from their dentist. Also I want to contribute to an honest learning environment and reach out to any peers that I may see struggling.",D3L

Currently I am really interested in the field of pediatrics so I want to put myself in the position to learn as much as I can about the field and make sure when I do make a decision that it is an informed one.

While my passion in pediatrics grows from partaking in in-reach and out-reach events at NYUCD, I want to also explore other specialties so I can become a wholesome in my dental knowledge and ideals.

I am really happy this year that Citizen Schools has been fully integrated as one of the main outreach clubs at NYUCD. We also had our first dental screenings at GTP and many more scheduled to come. Also I am on track to pursue my passion in pediatrics.",D3L

So far into the year I have been good about being punctual but I want to persist in having good punctuality as it was a weakness of mine in the past.

I still feel I can be more organized. My work area still gets really messy after the treatment is done and sometimes I still forget all the supplies I need for that session. Out of all the clinical treatments we perform I still feel not as comfortable with endo and crown treatments.",D3L
22,QRWhtutX,Public Self Reflection,04-06-16 15:05,15.08333333,"I believe in order to become a professional in the field of dentistry, you must go beyond knowing just the craft of dentistry. It also means how you present yourself and how you treat the people you are working with. For instance punctuality and respect are two important aspects that patients look for in a dentist aside from his/her technical abilities. A dentist that is unorganized or difficult to make appointments with is hard for the patient to trust in putting their oral health in. Also even though the dentist is the head of his/her practice, it takes a cohesive and supportive team of individuals to treat the dental patient properly. Thus, a dentist that does not present him/herself to the dental team in a professional manner will never gain their trust.

One of the most important thing is to really listen to the patient's concerns. Don't approach a treatment session without an open mind, sometimes you need to adapt to the patient's needs.",D3L

I do know that if I feel that I am not ready once I graduate from dental school I will immediately look to do some residency to get myself to the level of competency I am comfortable to practice solo. I do want to eventually have my own dental practice and after some time try to expand.

At this point I am thinking of going into a career where I am practicing part time as a pediatric dentist but also explore the public health side of our profession. I think there is large room to grow especially for finding ways to target areas that are not having access to dental outreaches/screenings.",D3L
24,QRWhtutX,Public Personal,04-06-16 14:54,14.9,"I hope to become competent enough that when I graduate my friends, peers, and instructors will fully trust me to perform dentistry on them if need be. I hope to at least maintain the passion I had for this field when I walked to my first class this year and hopefully expand that passion when I graduate. I want to work  hard and to always be humble of the fact that I should never be satisfied with my level of competence in dentistry. As long as I keep learning I know I will be more competent than yesterday but not as competent as I can be tomorrow. Areas that I need to work on is to be less stubborn, to be more open minded, and I need to be organized with my clinics and lab from the get go to not get messy habits. As well I want to present myself in a more professional manner to my patients as I am a representative of this school and my professional profession.

Most of my patients want to give me the ""Dr"" title, but I really believe that I have not earned that distinction as of yet.  I usually just tell them to call me Mike/Michael.  I think that I will still be the same way once I have received the Dr. distinction.  I am not sure why that is though. Maybe it is due to my background and how I was brought up, but I just consider myself like everyone else with the only exception being that I would actually be a doctor.  Only when I am not around other dental students do I feel more like a dental professional.  My parents, brother, girlfriend and non-dental friends always ask me dental related questions, and I feel like I actually know what I am talking about with them, which makes me feel more and more like a dentist.",D3L

I finally get to apply the knowledge that i've gained in my D1 and D2 years, as well as gain new knowledge and tips/tricks from the D4s and various faculties.  When I first started in clinic I was very nervous and unsure of how I would be able to deal with treating my patients.  Now that I have been in clinic for approximately 1 year, I feel more comfortable and competent in my abilities.  At first, the majority of my treatments were SRPs, and I feel like I know how to efficiently and properly complete these procedures.  Now I find that I am completing more complex procedures and becoming more comfortable in performing root canals, post/cores, crowns and complete and removable prostheses.  I also find that I am relying less and less on specialty faculties when assessing my patients' more complex needs and I only consult with them as a necessary step to confirm my findings/results.",D3L

While it was great to gain all the didactic knowledge, I did not know how it would be utilized when I had to perform the procedure on a patient.  The first few months of clinic were very slow, as I was very nervous and unsure of my knowledge and skills in terms of treating a patient.  However, with more exposure I believe that I have slowly become a more competent practitioner.  I find that my hand skills, diagnosing ability and performance when performing more complex procedures has significantly increased since I started clinic.  There are still certain aspects that I feel like I need to work on more, such as taking initial impressions for diagnostic stone models, however, I feel like these skills will only develop with more practice and attention to details and what I may be doing wrong with certain procedures.

I recently had a patient look me in the eyes and say, ""I trust your judgment, I'll do what you think is best."" Many would appreciate hearing this; however, I actually felt a sense of burden. The burden of making a clinically sound decision, a decision that the patient expects will be a long term, sustainable solution. On the other end of the spectrum, it's a decision that abides by the ethics principles and values. I have had patients confide in me with medical and health related matters and furthermore ask for professional advice in regard to their wellbeing. This is something I do not take for granted and I intend to uphold the greatest level of confidentiality when it comes to patient care.

I am mostly leaning towards practicing dentistry as a profession, but I want to keep my options open in regards to a career in academia. More recently I've been interested the most in Periodontics.

The former is necessary because without a solidified background regarding these sciences, one may not be able to deliver proper oral healthcare.  The first year covered many courses, such as anatomy, physiology, and neuroscience.  The second year covered more pathology and diagnosis of certain oral conditions.

Based on the articles, studies have shown that multitasking is not efficient - it just interrupts our train of thought as we deplete our resources. However, I believe that as we advance throughout time, generation after generation is becoming more capable of doing this, as it seems more like a necessity rather than an option. In a student's perspective, we might try to do more than 1 thing at a time because we have so many obligations. However, as a healthcare practitioner, it is important to do things methodically, one step at a time. It is only then are we able to deliver efficient healthcare.",D3L

However, as I started treating real patients,  the meaning of being a professional became less of an amorphous ideal, and more of a real challenge. At this point in my career, besides the medical aspect of the profession, I noticed that I have to put greater effort into my communication skills when interacting with patients, faculty, and my classmates. I accept the challenge as an honor, and am doing my best to be successful at it. My primary goal is to provide the best dental care to my patients, while learning and growing along the way. It is very satisfactory to learn about new techniques, and master my dental skills every day of clinic.
The more clinic experience I gain, the more I realize, that the most difficult part in dentistry is often the decisions you have to make before practical dentistry even begins - treatment planning. Gaining all the information, providing the diagnosis, considering the prognosis,  balancing all the risks and benefits, working with patient's dental desires versus financial abilities/available dental techniques/health issues, etc - is not easy. Once the decision is made - the procedure is usually straight forward.

Reflection on the ""Infomagical Challenge"" article:
Success is often directly connected to one's ability to focus. Focusing on one thing at a time is important - here I agree with the authors, but implementing this ability in practice is more like an unreachable goal. I tried to follow the directions in the article and concentrating on one thing only during the last Sunday. However, pretty much every time there came some distraction - a phone call, my 5yo son desperately in need to show me something he just discovered, UPS dropped a package, etc... It was a real challenge. I don't like to give up, and I still am convinced that the ability to focus is utterly important. With that said, I also think that it is pretty unrealistic to concentrate 100% on one thing only for a long time in this day and age. I guess technology challenged us and changed the way we are wired now. I came to a conclusion that multitasking (even though it doesn't exist) - switching from one task to another, and back again - is as much important, and I am willing to burn extra calories if that's what it takes.",D3L
17,U3zr0SyU,Public Personal,18-06-16 13:33,13.55,"While at NYU, I'd like to keep an open mind and talk to as many peers and faculty members as possible.  I plan on participating in outreach opportunities domestically and abroad. I hope to incorporate my experiences and education in public health when I graduate from NYU College of Dentistry to have a career in both clinical work and research. I am particularly interested in helping underserved populations, especially children. For me, it is important to increase access to dental services in my community and emphasize education as a means of oral disease prevention.


The Infomagical podcast emphasized focusing in on the task at hand and trying to reduce other distractions or commitments in order to be the most effective at completing the said task. While I agree that focusing in on a particular job or task and shutting off our minds/hearts to everything else that may be going on would help reduce stress and enable us to become more efficient, it is not acheiveable at NYUCD. At NYUCD, our schedules are constructed in a way that we CANNOT attend all our classes, treat all our patients, study for all our exams, have time for lunch and maintain focus on the particular task at hand. We are forced to constantly think about what is next or what else we should be doing at that moment. The demands placed on us make it impossible to truly focus on what is in front of us and ignore the noise that surrounds us on a daily basis. Additionally, juggling patient care/scheduling/finances, studying, and our outside family/friends make it very difficult to truly zero in on the moment, release stress, and get away from ""work."" I'd like to be more mindful and try to limit the noise that surrounds me because it would be more beneficial but most of the time it is similar impossible.

The role of a mid-level provider in dentistry is controversial. Many dentists feel threatened that a mid-level provider would take over the dentist job. I personally feel that a mid-level provider in dentistry is needed and would help solve the access to care issues that a large part of our country faces. The mid-level dental therapist role has been popular and successful in New Zealand and other parts of the world.",D3L

Dr. Studley recently shared and article about focus. Our current environment has a myriad of factors and tasks constantly demanding our attention. However, the human brain is capable of processing only one thing at a time, and we are fooling ourselves into thinking we can ""multi-task"". While I agree with the article, I cannot imagine focusing on a singular task at a given point of time especially as a dental student. Further, when we graduate and are working as employees or employers, have spouses and possibly children, parents, I cannot imagine a situation where my attention won't be pulled in several different directions.

Online assignment reflection: Being in a very intense 4 year dental program we constantly find ourselves multi-tasking. With clinical requirements and deadlines/ patients/ formatives/competencies/ didactic courses/applications/boards... etc it is very hard to ""shut off"" our multi-tasking and try focus on one thing. Yes, I agree the work suffers and I am physically and emotionally tired, but the countless deadlines make it nearly impossible to focus on one thing. The constant reminders of requirements, competencies, formatives on time prevents us from focusing on one thing alone. I agree with the podcast that we would be more efficient and less drained but does not seem possible in dental school.

At NYUCD, we are taught to comprehensively treat patients for everything they need.

I really like that the school forces us to address each and every problem and that patients get turned away if they don't want to adhere to those rules. I feel like this promotes proper practice of dentistry for when we graduate. If a patient has severely periodontally compromised mandibular teeth and wants a maxillary denture he's missing these teeth, according to protocol, we can't make him a maxillary denture without treating his compromised teeth first. I feel like this is such an important part of our education, because as a dentist, I am responsible for not just the state of a patient's oral health at the moment, but to make sure that after I treat any patient, that they don't eventually suffer because of something I failed to acknowledge.",D3L

The ability to build and maintain friendly and stimulating relationships, whilst considering differences in culture and values displays tact and diplomacy. Integrity is the competency of fighting for the principles and beliefs, even in situations where it is difficult to do so. Through the assessment of situations in defining the problem, judgmental analysis is exhibited through critical analysis, prioritization, and creativeness.

I have heard many stories from faculty members or through my research online of ethical violations committed by dentists in practice. From adding surfaces to restorations to completing unnecessary treatment. As health professionals, we owe it to our patients to maintain the highest level of integrity. Patients do not possess the ability to interpret radiographs or detect clinical caries. They trust our clinical judgement and accept treatment based on what we tell them. This is a responsibility that I take very seriously. I strive to provide the highest level of care for all of my patients while ensuring to never violate any ethical principles.",D3L

In just one year of clinical experience I have done cavity fillings, crowns, root canals, extractions and full and partial dentures. I have learned how to communicate efficiently with my patients and understand their concerns through careful listening and empathy.

Those first 2 years are heavily didactically driven and the majority of one's time is taken up studying for one exam after another. While second year introduced more simulated clinical experiences, the majority of my focus was consumed with studying and spending late hours in lab preparing for pre-clinical practicals. I couldn't quite fathom the transition from a typodont to a real mouth. 

My first couple weeks in clinic were rather rough. I'm not generally an anxious person, however, I always felt a certain uneasiness coming to clinic. I was fearful that I would cause harm to one of my patients. Like anything else, my confidence began to increase as time progressed. The radiographs didn't become as hard to interpret, administering anesthesia became less terrifying, rubber dam isolation was achieved quicker, etc. I am now midway through D3 and I am astonished with how much I have developed as a dental professional.",D3L

Toward the beginning of the semester I felt uncomfortable and unsure of what I was doing in lab and always sought assurance prior to beginning. However, as the semester progressed this was no longer the case. I look forward to the second year as I know I will only continue to improve and strengthen my hand skills.

I am really enjoying dental school as a 2nd year dental student. I feel like the didactic courses are more related to the field of dentistry, and like the variety of the lab courses. I have grown especially fond of CR1 and CR2. My favorite exercises in CR1 would have to be crown preps while I thoroughly enjoyed the RPD portion of the CR2 course.

Third year is without a doubt my favorite thus far. Everyone says they come to dental school to help patients, but one does not truly realize the impact they can have on a person's oral health until they actually start treating patients. I have found clinic to be immensely gratifying. The ability to restore functionality to an edentulous patient is greatly satisfying to me.

I never knew how much fun dentistry is. I have came across such a diverse patient population. I have helped patients restore their teeth. I now understand the bigger picture of dentistry.

This is sometimes harder said than done, as no one wants to call up a patient to tell them they have to come in for yet another final impression, or that the lab work that was sent back is not fitting.

To obtain these attributes I will try to use every opportunity that NYU offers during the next four years, opportunities ranging from community outreach, club organizations and the great faculty that always are willing to help students. Ultimately during the next four years I want to come out as a well rounded dentist. Being a well rounded dentist will only make me that much better at what I do and can do for my patients.

This includes learning the certain ethics involved in treating patients as I want to be as fair as I can as my decision-making.

The idea of learning after making a mistake is something I try to avoid but I realize it was these experiences that made me grow the most.

This includes that every dentist has their own personal theory about what it means to be a professional, some which I agree with and others not so much. I still think the most radical changes in my progress will come when I have to interact with patients.

Often times, we would have upperclassmen share previous exams and study sheets and it was our decision to distribute them to create a level playing ground when it was exam day. During second year, we saw many of our classmates going to all distances to succeed on practicals and competencies, whether that meant bringing pre-prepared teeth or drilling outside the mouth. It was up to us whether we approach our classmates and challenge their moral standards. As a third year, the quest for CEE and MDR leads students to questionable ethical decisions and tests our ethical judgement since we must always remember to put our patient's needs first and foremost.",D3L

For the past few years, I have been shadowing in the pediatrics department to learn more regarding the special ways that a dentist must attend to pediatric patients.

Ethics in the clinic setting is a little bit different. I want to be able to the best for the patient but sometimes it's the patient or other factors that prevent me from doing so. For example, I just had a patient who received crowns on #8 & 9 that was approved by the financial manager prior to sending out for fabrication. After the crowns were delivered, I received an email stating that the crowns are not covered and the patient will be billed accordingly. I feel that the patient is being wronged by being forced to pay for a procedure that we pre-approved but at the same time, it's not something that I can rectify.",D3L

Ethics, D1 leadership seminar, SAPL, and clinical seminars provided us with information that can help us build our identity as a professional healthcare provider.

The D2 year was probably the most difficult academic year in my entire career. However, it helped me change my cramming study habits into a balanced one. Introduction to the clinic was nerve-wrecking at first, but I got used to it.

I wish to excel in a clinical and lab setting as well in academic courses. I want to create strong networks both inside and outside of the school that can hopefully last throughout and after dental school. After graduation, I wish to be a competent, passionate, friendly professional to provide and care for the oral health of New York City. I want to be a dentist that my patients can trust me in issues on not only oral health but other issues as well.

After finishing the hardest academic year of my career, I am ready to shift my focus on being a better clinician.

We all have requirements to meet and competencies to take and sometimes we may find ourselves drafting a more elaborate treatment plan than what the patient actually needs in order to benefit ourselves. However, as a health professional, I must keep in mind my patient's interests above my own. So far I have really kept to the ethical standards and have not done something for my patient that is against his or her own wishes. Ethics is communicating to the patient all the alternatives to a treatment plan and then let him or her decide what is going to be done.

Ethics is doing what's objectively right for the patient and trying to change the patient's own personal perspectives that may be detrimental to his or her own health. Being an ethical professional means doing what's morally and objectively right for the patient all the time despite conditions that can influence one's own personal opinions.",D3L

Besides having the right skills to treat patients, I have discovered that effective communication and patient management skills can make my experience of treating patients much more enjoyable at the college. I have had some patients tell me that they're very motivated to come to their visits on time and ready for treatment so that they can get their partial dentures quicker. These are the same patients who are on their first visit, excited about being treated in an educational environment, where there are plenty of faculty around to check on the work of the students to ensure good quality work is being produced. However, when they hear that on average it can take minimally 3 months for a set of dentures to be completed, between the time the materials are being sent back and forth from the lab, they just tend to disappear on me. How I manage these patients is I always explain to them all the pros and cons of the procedures they need and to them I always sound very knowledgeable. I have always been able to communicate effectively in terms of why they need certain kinds of treatment and what they should expect next. Nonetheless, I still have the one or two few stubborn ones who will say yes to everything and then they would fail the next two appointments. So if the explaining doesn't work, then I just kind of put these patients aside and just ignore them completely until they reach out to me themselves to schedule an appointment. Even after making an appointment for them, I will still warn them that if they fail the appointment one more time, I will remove them permanently from my roster. When I first started clinic, I wouldn't have managed my patients this way. I treated everyone nicely and wouldn't retaliate even when certain patients failed to show up once or twice. However, eventually I became fed up of having these kinds of patients ruin my clinical experience and me not being able to get anything done. Now that I have become ""meaner"" so to say, I have finally whipped some of my patients into shape. I won't let the one or few bad apples ruin my clinical experience when I have other patients who stick up for me in front of the faculty for being a great doctor in every aspect. Regardless of whether or not a patient chooses to continue treatment at the school, I always get the comment from every new patient that I always make them feel welcome and that I always take the time to communicate with them so that they don't just feel like objects that are there for me to drill on.

From the time I got braces from the orthodontist as a teenager and after I saw how much they improved my smile and bite after they were removed, I knew I was interested in the field of dentistry where I can provide immediate positive results for my patients.

I never thought communication and interpersonal skills were as important during the first two years of didactic studies. Now, I have discovered that communication is very important in enabling patients to understand me and to understand and appreciate the services I am providing for them. I've learned to be more expressive of myself and not just assume people know what I'm thinking of all the time.

Now that I have been treating patients in the clinic for a few months now, I have professionally matured as an empathetic, caring health professional. I am usually not one who speaks very slowly to express my thoughts; however, in front of my patients, I always take the time now to explain dental concepts to them to make sure they know what's going on and that they're comfortable with me before I proceed with a given procedure. Even though I'm still in the process of improving my skills in the various dental procedures I have never been exposed to before, I am still able to retain a friendly rapport with my patients so that they trust me to treat them. Their confidence in me enables me to feel much more comfortable with what I'm doing.

I strive now to become a well rounded clinician, one who can be held accountable for my own actions and one who does what's best for the patients all the time.

It has been almost a whole year that I have started to treat my own patients in clinic. There is no better satisfaction than being able to improve my patient's oral health and smile and being that clinician to make the special difference. Besides the technical aspects of dentistry, I find that patients pay more attention to how much I care about them and not how much I know. I'm glad to know that I'm not only a dental technician to my patients but also a friend who can lend an ear and actually listen to what they have to say as well.

Now that I'm a rising D4, I definitely have become more familiar with clinical procedures and am more confident in the work that I do. I have matured over this last year that I have been in clinic.

Additionally, I joined Class Council in D2 as a curriculum rep and continue this role into D3. Keeping the class informed of our academic responsibilities has naturally forced me to stay on top of my own responsibilities.

Personally, I performed 3 RCTs in 4 hours, 18 extractions over 2 days, and 26 restorations in another 2 days. Equally important, I met with many young Nicaraguans and discussed their daily lives, their struggles to obtain healthcare, dental care and an education.

In September, I secretly questioned whether I had the steady hands to make it as a dentist. Over the next few months I found myself completely comfortable with a high speed hand piece and scoring 85s and 100s on practicals. This put me in a somewhat unique position to help my classmates and impart some of the skills and advice that I had received from upperclassmen and faculty. 
The amount of scientific knowledge I have gained over the past year is astonishing. In the beginning, I wondered if it was humanely possible. By the end, I was thirsty for more.
One hard lesson that I learned was that I need to be more organized and more proactive when it comes to science courses. Time is a valuable thing in dental school, and learning to manage it better and maximize productivity is my immediate goal going forward.
During the summer and early fall, I found myself feeling - for the first time in my life - the stress and anxiety that comes from self-placed pressure to do well.

      I've been pursuing this goal by challenging myself to do better academically. D2, although more difficult and stressful, was a much better year in terms of grades than D1. Additionally, I joined Class Council in D2 as a curriculum rep and continue this role into D3. Keeping the class informed of our academic responsibilities has naturally forced me to stay on top of my own responsibilities. 
      In clinic, I approach every patient and every procedure as a learning opportunity. I Know my skills are not the best - I don't expect to deliver the best care. However, I know that every clinic session is another step towards improving my skills. Every day is a new learning opportunity and I always look forward to it. 
      I was one of the outreach chairs for ASDA in D2. We developed 3 new local outreaches from the ground up and revamped an educational outreach. This role allowed me to gain more social awareness of the barriers to healthcare at home. As part of the Global Outreach team to Nicaragua in D3, I was involved in treating over 700 patients. Personally, I performed 3 RCTs in 4 hours, 18 extractions over 2 days, and 26 restorations in another 2 days. Equally important, I met with many young Nicaraguans and discussed their daily lives, their struggles to obtain healthcare, dental care and an education. It was a powerful experience in dentistry and public health.
      Along the way, I will strive to develop strong personal and professional relationships that have a positive impact in my life as well as in the field of dentistry.",D3L

Some people just want to get by, and some people wants to shoot for OMFS/Ortho. What I realize throughout the year was that NYUCD tests you on ""how to take the test"" instead of the class material. Many time, the material that were tested on the test were never covered by the professors and they were just reused questions from the quiz bank, perhaps developed by previous professors. Thus, in order to be the top of the class, you need to you have those past exams. Inevitably, students will find their way to get to those past exams and this was considered cheating. Perhaps, if the professors try to make up new questions every year (like the professors in undergrad), not only the letter grade will truly show a particular student's understanding in the material but also cheating will cease in the future.",D3L

These principles are imperative since they define you as a dentist and differentiates you, giving you more credibility as a professional.",D3L

I also want to be knowledgable of how to communicate properly with a patient and teach them how to better their habits and also about their condition. It is important to be knowledgable about the basic sciences involved the different diseases and pathologies that a patient may have, which is why it is important to learn as much academically as possible.

It is also important to express empathy towards the patient so they feel comfortable in the environment and so they can gain trust in their healthcare provider. A professional should maintain respect for their patients and hold themselves with integrity. Self assessment is a critical component in becoming a competent professional since it allows one to see where they were and how much they have progressed. It also allows one to realize that there is always more room to grow and it allows one to add on to the list of what they find the most valuable.

The choices we face with patients and the best treatment that we can provide sometimes conflict with patient's ability to afford and the patient's perception of what is needed. I did not understand how the steps of treatment planning had an integral part of ethics within its infrastructure. I do understand much better now of why us, the practitioners, need a firm understanding of ethical guidelines to make our treatment planning decision.

In society, we are constantly judged, main on our appearance and how we talk to others. By implementing this, we are being motivated to carry ourselves as a professional dentist on day 1, despite ever picking up a dental instrument. From looking at the syllabus, I like how the curriculum incorporates a hand-full of courses that strives us to be professionals, instead of having only courses that focuses on science- and dentistry-related. I feel that this will prove beneficial when we actually have to interact and communicate with patients, where their assessment means a lot.

As far as I'm concerned, having every drug and prescription memorized is an unnecessary waste of my time.

I've gotten much better at diagnosing my own patients, reading X rays, understanding medical complications, and my work has gotten more efficient.

By not learning and getting your way through school doing the bare minimum and relying on others to help you do what is your homework, you are going to reach the clinic in third year lacking a lot of skills that your colleagues will have. Of course many people have many different views on what is ethical and what is not, but there are some universal commonalities that everyone in the right state of mind will define as ethical vs unethical.

However, ethics can sometimes mean working in a gray area that is neither black nor white. This requires a state of mind that provides good judgment in deciding the balance between right and wrong, right and more right, or the lesser of two evils. The goal of being ethically aware is to act accordingly and appropriately. An example of ethics in dentistry is to know when to refer out because of one's limitations and weaknesses in doing certain procedures. This is a difficult task for some individuals because ego can give them a false sense of confidence. On the other hand, practicing dentistry also means to venture out of one's comfort zone slightly in order to grow clinically and to become a better dentist. While the risks and rewards of practicing dentistry must be assessed, it is important to keep the patient's best interest as a top priority.

If I can't think about all of this and execute all of this within the next 45 minutes I will not be successful for the day.

It is essential for me to try and learn from them all the time.

Sometimes I am a little intimidated of this word, just because I would not want to claim being a professional without being certain that I possess all the characteristics of the word. It amazes me how much society values professionals and look at them with such respect. One of the aspects that I appreciate about all professionals is that the looks and dress-code of a professional matters quite a bit.

Also, we must strive to provide the best treatment for our patients and to avoid causing them harm. By following these ethical principles, I will be a better clinician and will be able to serve my patients in the future. There are always difficult cases where different ethical principles come into conflict and learning how to ethically proceed is an important skill to have.

Being a professional involves possessing the correct knowledge to share with your patients in a respectful and effective manner. It is also important to dress professionally since patients can make many assumptions about a person from their appearance alone. By dressing and acting maturely, patients feel like they are in capable hands and will be open to listening to advice that is given. We should work to actively involve our patients in the treatment planning process, but we must make sure we do not let them dictate the treatment plan to us.

I am now treating patients and learning how to interact with them appropriately as a dental professional. I am also learning how treating people is very different from working on plastic teeth on a simulated dummy. It is a wonderful change and I am enjoying the challenges that come along with it.

I think there should be stricter punishments for being caught as I think cheating devalues the dental education when people are able to continue these habits and do not face consequences.

I am also concerned with how people treat patients. I recognize that the school puts pressures on us. In order to graduate on time we have MDR requirements and a certain number of CEEs to complete. We must make patients a priority. It's not ethically sounds to see a patient as CEEs before seeing the patient as a person first. This is especially true with the the year coming to an end and the stress of the completion of MDRs.

In addition, I think that nonmaleficence, one of the bioethical principles we are taught to abide has environmental considerations. I think as responsible health care profressionals we should also be educated on the impact of our work on the environment. Environmental health impacts our patient's health. The waste and materials used in dentistry should be more critically looked at to ensure we are not doing harm to our current and future patients.


I have had to make a difficult realization that as much as it is important to help people, you shouldn’t stop going out of your way for your patients. However, you need to realize that you cannot help people who are not ready to help themselves.

Since then, I have felt like I had more of an interest in faculty practice and oral medicine. I have been accepted into an Honors in Oral Medicine and have spent the last few weeks becoming accustomed to the program. I have an interest in oral medicine as I have gained a lot of respect for the faculty that run the elective. The faculty have been great professors in OMPR and General Pathology. I also have a history of cancer in my family and feel like I would be good at empathizing with patients who have a suspicious lesion and have come in for a biopsy.
 I have looked into pediatrics as I completed 6 month clinic observation at Bellevue. Pediatrics may be something I consider after I have practiced general dentistry for a few years. Due to financial constraints and anxiousness to get out of school and get into practice, I will put this off and reevaluate in a few years whether it is something I would like to commit to.

I have learned that I need to become more independent in clinic. It is important as I am approaching my 4th year that I transition to being able to make my own decisions in terms of patient care and then finalize these plans with the faculty. Next year, I will be practicing next year under my own license.",D3L
69,UNeX45gI,Private Self Reflection,07-06-16 13:09,13.15,"I find the greatest challenge for me in attempting to be a professional is my nervousness and cautious nature when it comes to treating patients. I am not at my best if I don't feel confident and it is really challenging to feel confident when you're trying to complete a task you have only done once or twice before. I don't think nervousness and professionalism go hand in hand. A patient needs to feel that they can trust in their doctor and if they aren't confident in themselves how can a patient be confident and comfortable with the doctor? I have overcome this challenge with really developing strong relationships with my patients. I think my patients understand that I am very knowledgeable and that I am cautious as I do not want to make a mistake (and this stems from my interest in offering them the best possible care). I would much prefer if I could be confident in myself and be able to stay calm during a procedure but that will come with time and experience. I am confident that my nervousness will be reduced with time as it has already reduced in the passing months.

One of my more recent challenges when it comes to being nervous during treatment was completing a pulpotomy. The patient had very dense bone and the tooth was very hypersensitive due to inflammation. The patient was very sensitive as I approached the pulp but I knew that I had to reach the pulp and administer a intrapulpal injection as quickly as possible. The patient was moving his head every time I attempted to gain access. I was nervous he would hurt himself or myself. I overcame this challenge by thinking I that I wanted to minimize pain overall- some short term pain for long term relief.


I anticipate that I will be reviewing notes and podcasts often in the first few years of practice. It is one thing to learn knowledge prior to first hand experience and accessing information at the time of having a patient with a need in front of you. A professional keeps up with current knowledge, recognizes weakness and acts to strengthen each weakness.",D3L

The definition of a professional is simple to state but challenging to follow through on with every single patient in every single circumstance. Some days are harder than others- you're frustrated, you have challenges outside of the clinic that are on your mind. I think a professional is someone who tries their best to uphold a standard but recognizes his/her short comings. A professional knows when to step away from a situation and breathe and manage a situation to the best of their ability while recognizing the challenges. Working with the public can be challenging, people get frustrated, treatments can be difficult and though you may feel like stepping away, you need to continue and push through.

I am beginning to appreciate how there are multiple ‘right ways’ of doing things- this brings me some peace that if you are following evidence based research and fulfilling patient goals, you are practicing responsibly.",D3L

I feel that I am very patient centered- I really care for their overall well-being and I think this is a very important quality when treating people with suspicious lesions or pathology. 

I  thought that after being in clinic for the past several months would allow me to be less nervous around my patients. I have made improvements but I am still a nervous and cautious person by nature. I am confident that with time it will lessen. I have already seen improvements. One week I can't figure out how exactly to remove a temporary crown, I am struggling with the removal of the cement etc but then just that next week I had a patient requiring the same treatment and after having experienced this once before, working with the temporary came very easily. It was after I gained confidence through experience did I feel prepared to see this second patient.

The more I think about it, I think that the reason that I am finding clinic challenging is that I am really trying my best to do it all. Becoming a dentist shouldn't be easy, you're working with people with strong personalities and opinions, there are barriers to care such as finances and insurance terminations, medical consults that put care on pause. It is not as simple as just doing the treatments that patients need. I am trying to give each patient the best possible care but it really can be a challenge sometimes, it is more than likely that there will be an unforseen roadblock. My next steps will be to anticipate roadblocks before they happen.

I was extremely challenged in my first oral surgery rotation. I felt that my previous encounter with my wisdom tooth extraction that left me traumatized. I had to overcome a lot to be able to extract a tooth. After a week of observing and learning I was finally able to extract a tooth on the last day and it was a great growing experience for myself.

I have been given the opportunity to explore sustainable dentistry. I have held a class council role and two student council greening representative positions.  I spoke at several conferences on the topic ASDA conference, EUEC conference, NYUCD Research days, Sigma Xi Conference.  

I completed a clinic observation February-June 2015 at Bellevue in the pediatric dental clinic as I was looking into a pediatrics specialization. I think I will spend a few years as a general dentist after graduation but will keep pediatrics as an option for the future if I am feeling unfulfilled as a 'kid friendly' general dentist.

I've been surprised how honest and candid some of my patients have been with me, and they put a huge amount of trust into me. I think it would be unethical for me to try and perform a procedure that I know I am not skilled at just to get CEs or MDRs.

Dentistry gives us an opportunity to providing lasting relationships with people, something I truly enjoy and that's one of the biggest reasons I pursued this field. But (and you may completely disagree with me) one of the other reasons I also made this decisions was because I assumed I wouldn't be dealing with too much tragedy. Yes we encounter oral cancer in our profession but we don't often deal with giving heartbreaking news to our patients like some other fields in medicine. But recently I had an experience with a new patient that's changed that for me. Here was a middle aged man going through the process of full mouth extractions and complete dentures because he has Parkinson's disease, and he and his mother have already started thinking planning for the disease progression, and decided that on overdenture would be practical.

But I don't know if the specific way I'm holding my hand, or bur is hurting the patient, etc. I keep asking patients if they're ok or if something hurts. I feel like it might be too much, as if I'm portraying a lack of confidence.
Additionally, I am also figuring out the right balance between warmth and openness while also maintaining a professional demeanor. I enjoy being friendly with patients and making them feel relaxed, talking with them and engaging with them.

For a long time, I liked to think that coming across as unprofessional didn't matter, that it wasn't a sign or your intelligence or goodness. And while that still holds true, certain aspects of what we define professionalism as are integral to patient care. I can appreciate the importance of being on time, to set up for your patient and to not keep them waiting. I can understand how physical appearance and mannerisms can affect patients. Many of the people who come to see us are nervous, uncomfortable and truly scared, and it can be reassuring to see someone who presents themselves as a professional.

My two favorite parts of this experience so far have been relieving someones pain and calming someone down. It's such a personal connection, and deeply gratifying.
Parts of school are really frustrating because I feel limited. I feel limited in the speed of which I can do something for a patient, having to constantly keep them waiting for swipes or sensors.

It is a good lesson to remember that just because there is a reward for a procedure does not mean that you can rush and do a bad job. This is not like other professions, because compensation in dentistry is based on a treatment given to another human being who pretty much always does not have all the information to disagree with the dentist about a treatment.

If a dentist does anything bad (shooting lions, bad case of road rage, using known dirty needles), it reflects poorly on all of us and all members of the dental community suffer from one person's actions. By becoming a student at NYU we instantly became a part of the small community of dentists. It is important to be professional so that we have the respect and trust of our patients. If our patients do not trust and respect us they will start taking their dental health into their own hands and oral health will decline. We also need to be professional so that other dentists can be proud of the profession we are all a part of. Any time one dentist makes a mistake, it hurts the whole community. I didn't realize how much this was true until I actually started working with patients and realized how important public image can be. With the world being so connected, it only takes one mistake for someone to lose all of the good will he/she has spent his/her entire life working for. When you are working with patients it is really important how you present yourself.",D3L

I understand so much more about dentistry now than when I arrived at dental school. I am really learning that there are times when you just need to put your nose down and work as hard as you possibly can. I feel like dental school is about to be very different. We are through with a lot of our courses and beginning the transition to clinic. Its crazy to think that the time has finally come where we will be seeing patients and actually functioning like dentists, but I think I am ready for the transition. Mastering how to be a student is different than mastering how to be a dentist. I think now is the time when we will really learn if we know how to be dentists. That being said it can be really easy to get discourages when it feels you have no patients and are falling behind. There are days when I leave clinic and I feel like I am awesome and can do anything. Then there are other days when I have shown up and I think I am prepared and the situation becomes something I never expected. I think I am getting better at handling the unknown and I definitely know how to do more procedures, but I am definitely still on my toes.",D3L

We are still under a lot of pressure from the school to meet certain requirements and get a certain number of points, so it can be hard to stay on track with what is really important. But, as I am facing my last year at NYU I am realizing how important it is to try to learn as much as I can everyday. Every patient is different and so every procedure is a little bit different too. At school there are plenty of people around to hold my hand if I am desperate and there is always someone who can show me the right way. I know that outside of school I am not going to be completely without help, but I will need to be much more independent. In these upcoming 12 months I want to focus on getting as much knowledge about dentistry as I possible can so that I am ready to actually leave school for the first time since I was five years old.",D3L

I learned the process of fabricating complete and removable partial dentures for both arches. During 3rd year, I apply the knowledge and skills I learned from the first two years to patient care, which is important to be a competent dentist. I have done a few restorations and cleanings on patients and I'm progressively getting used to clinic. I have done a few crowns and started working on dentures as well.

July and August:

I started getting used to the way the clinic works and how axium works. I saw/felt what caries is. I learned (and am still learning) how to correctly identify caries based on the ICDAS system.
I learned that a restoration needs to be redone if the explorer 'sticks' by the margins of the restoration. I also learned that, based on color, you can have a 'leaky' restoration even if the margins seem to be in-tact (I'm still not so clear on this). But if the margins have a tight seal and the radiograph shows a radiolucency under the restoration, we need to think about what this might be other than caries.
I also learned how to cut off a crown when it becomes locked on a tooth (Dr. Moghadam was kind enough to sit and do it with me).

Week of 8/31

I learned that grinding/clenching can be a cause of widened PDL and not automatically an endo problem.

Week of 9/7

In oral surgery rotation and learned how to use extraction tools and how to properly extract a tooth.

Week of 9/14

I need to brush up on the differences and indications for when to use a prefab crown and when to use a cast post-core crown.

Week of 9/21

I learned the indications for PAs in 1A rotations
I learned how to properly do RCT
I made the mistake of not paying attention to detail before a tx, during a tx, and after a tx
I learned how to do proper tests/diagnosis when a patient presents to the clinic in pain

Week of 9/28
I learned the proper indications for diagnosis of emergency tx when a patient is in pain.

Week of 10/05
My patient this week came in with very deep caries. The caries was very black and I want to know why that happened. It ended up needing a root canal and I didn't really see why. Endo and general faculty said that the decay was circumferential around the canal, so I guess I just need to see more caries to understand.

Over the next 2 days I had no patients or cancellations so I helped out a lot in the clinic. I realized that I was able to think on my feet much better when it's not my patient. I keep getting flustered when I present a case to faculty...I need to work on that. I also realized that I have a much better understanding of prefabs and cast posts and when they are indicated.

I had a patient at the end of the week that I Tx planned with Dr. Soeprono. I realized that I feel very lost when I'm checking for caries and open margins on restorations and crowns. Unless it's blatant, my caries and open margin diagnosis is usually incorrect. I guess this is normal, but it's not reassuring. Thankfully Dr. Soeprono is very understanding when it comes to this situation.

Week of 10/12
My first patient of the week is my most complicated case and it's been overwhelming. I work very slowly when I'm treating him and it's hard to break that bad rhythm. I'm trying to be more prepared before I see the patient, but I feel like it's not working. Whenever a situation arises that's slightly different from the standard, I shut down and run to faculty. I feel like if I try to deal with the situation on my own then I might do something wrong or that I'm making a bad judgment call. I've been working with Dr. Moghadam she told me that she believes I know more than I think and that I should take more initiative and have more confidence when encountering slightly new situations (a situation I should be able to handle).

I had another patient that came in as an emergency and I should have known what to do to diagnose and treat the chief concern. I need to relax and keep a clear head when diagnosing.

Another patient this week was a little concerned because the prophy didn't take as long as usual. I found that amusing because I thought that it took me longer than usual because of the amount of calculus/plaque.

Week of 10/19

I didn't have many patients this week, so I spent my time observing other procedures and asking D4s misc question regarding fixed and removable pros.

I had a Class II restoration this week and I spent too much time trying to be conservative. The restoration was deep and I was very worried that I was going to hit the pulp. The restoration went well in the end.

Week of 10/26

I had to cut off a crown and redo a crown prep for a survey crown. Cutting off the crown was easier than I thought, but prepping the tooth was not. I also had trouble making a temp and faculty had to jump in and do it for me so I could end on time. I don't like when the faculty has to do this because it shows that I am not prepared enough. I know what I did wrong and hopefully I've moved passed those mistakes.

I had a restoration today that was deep and the patient was having pain once I reached the caries. Faculty tried to help get the patient anesthetized, but it didn't work. I'm curious as to why this happened as well as how to properly anesthetize the patient in this situation

I also had a few comprehensive exams to do this week and I'm not too happy about them. Diagnosing caries is very frustrating for me. Before I leave, I want to know how to diagnose caries based on ICDAS, but faculty seem to be split on this. I hear from the majority of faculty that the only way to clinically diagnose caries (unless there's gross cavitation) is by seeing if an explorer sticks. There are only a few faculty that go according to ICDAS and unfortunately it's frustrating.

Week of 11/2

This was an uneventful week since I didn't have many patients. I had a patient with the most calculus I had ever come across yet. I found that using the hand scalers was actually more effective in cleaning the supragingival calculus. It was more efficient and less painful for the patient (she is very sensitive to begin with).

I had a patient that needed a restoration done, but he came late so I only took impressions to make an occlusal guard (I'm realizing lately that I should take impressions of every patient I have at the first visit, this makes things easier down the line for subsequent treatments).

My patient came this week to have one of his teeth evaluated for RCT. The patient refused the treatment and much rather wanted to have it extracted instead. We went through the risks and benefits of both options and he decided on extraction. Dr. Soeprono made it very clear that everything must be well documented in the note (I can see this as being a good habit to develop so it doesn't come back to bite you in private practice).

Week of 11/9

I started a treatment of complete upper and lower dentures for a patient this week. On the one hand I have a good grasp on what needs to be done, but on the other hand I kind of feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. Border molding seems like a mystery to me of how it's done properly because we've never had real muscles and tissue to actually work with yet. I keep making it a point to ask Dr. Comut what he's looking for whenever I show him an impression, custom tray, border molding, etc. so I can understand what to look for myself even if I did it right by accident.

Week of 11/16

I had a patient this week that has a mouth full of caries and broken teeth. I felt very overwhelmed when I was doing the tx pl. I ended up speaking with Dr. Watson the next day when she was free to see where to go in the tx pl and I felt like I had a clearer picture of what to do and what to look for. I see that I need to understand when a tooth needs to be extracted and when a tooth should be saved (I can see that this depends on many factors, but I need a good system for determining this).

Also, I had a patient that presented with pain a few weeks ago and we diagnosed it as reversible pulpitis. We put IRM and it was less painful. We now took out the IRM and endo took a look to see if there are any fractures (which I learned can present as a dark line because bacteria might be stuck in the fracture). No fracture, but endo said to pack the composite slowly and incrementally so that there are no voids (some people are apparently more sensitive when it comes to having a filling and there being tiny voids).

I continued border molding this week. I suck. But I feel like I'm slowly getting the hang of it.


Week of  11/23

A patient came in this week complaining of pain. I really suck at treating emergency patients. I need to have the routine down of what to look for and what to ask. On the bright side, she was medically complex and I knew how to properly go about her tx and med consult.

Another patient came in this week with a totally bombed out third molar. I still don't have a handle on how we look at third molars. I thought the tooth could be saved, but the faculty immediately said it should be extracted because it's very bombed out AND it's a third molar.

I also continued border molding this week. I first had to adjust the custom tray properly. Dr. Comut showed me how to do this and it was super helpful. I really understood what he was trying to do and I feel like this really helped me. I hope I can reproduce this in other patients.

Week of 11/30

I had a patient this week that has severe periodontitis. He had a lot of crown and bridge work done and faculty said that he really just needs a full mouth SRP. I see why this was the case because his teeth were not mobile and it seemed better to leave everything along than to do a bunch of extractions. The patient also didn't want to have any teeth extracted. I asked perio about this later and I now understand that if a tooth has furcation involvement or severe bone loss/mobility, the patient is subject to developing an infection/abcess/cellulitis due to the bacteria trapped inside.
I started the SRP this week and it went pretty well.

Week of 12/07

I saw a sinus tract this week and it didn't look like I though it would. The pictures were were shown in class was just of a hole, but in the clinic it looked like a papule and you have to poke through it to trace the tract.


I had a patient come in for tx planning, but it was a disaster. I was bounced around from perio to pros and getting different opinions. I presented the case to Dr. Soeprono and that did not go well either. Dr. Soeprono was nice enough to walk me through the case and explain to me why Perio came up with the diagnosis that they did. I need to have a more though out opinion of what the tx pl should be before I come to faculty so I can learn something if I'm wrong.

I did a restoration this week that started as a class V but turned into a restoration that wen from facial to lingual. Interestingly we decided to not break contact and do the restoration from underneath. It took me a really long time and my back and butt were hurting, but Dr. Polokoff said I did a really good job and it was a hard restoration for anyone to do. He said I'll be one of the good D4s. That was nice.

Also, delivering an occlusal guard was easier than I thought.

Week of 12/14

I had a bunch of cancellations this week, but the main thing was border molding. I'm so slow and it's taking forever. The patient is also complaining of pain a lot, even when pros works with her. I'm learning new tricks here and there, but overall I think I just need to be more aggressive and confident in what I'm looking for.

Week of 1/4

My most complex patient is getting harder to handle. His mouth is just falling apart. His temp keeps coming off and now one of his crowns that he had done a year ago just broke off. I'm emailing back and forth between Dr. Soeprono and Dr. Moghadam to see what to do. It's kind of stressful, but I'm also learning a lot from the case...especially the fact that I must be faster in doing treatment.

Week of 1/11

I was in perio clinic all week. I got to see how to place bone grafts and implants. I also saw immediate implant placements. It was not what I thought it would be. I though it would be more guided, but it just seems like they have an idea of what angle to place the implant and they drill the hole.

Week of 1/18

I finally made the new treatment plan for my most complex patient. I sent work up to the lab, but it got sent back for overlooked details. I even had to go up to the lab with Dr. Moghadam last Friday to straighten something out. I'm trying my hardest to get this treatment done as quickly as possible.

Week of 1/25

I had a paient this week with an enormous BP reading and it showed me how important it is for a dentist to actually record vitals. After that experience, a few patients mentioned to me that they discovered they had high BP from coming to NYU for a dental checkup. I'd like to take this lesson with me throughout my career.

I did a class II on friday and it was a redo of an old restoration. The prep and restoration went really well and I was happy with it, but it took me way too long. I haven't done that many class IIs, but I need to be cognizant of the fact that I need to be more efficient. I'm way to conservative when I know I shouldn't be (even though I think being conservative is a good trait in its proper setting).

I had some cancellations this week, so I spent some of my free time speaking with Dr. Mohajer to get a better understanding of when we diagnose a tooth as hopeless. This was extremely helpful and I feel like I'm more aware of factors at play that would compromise the health of a tooth.

Week of 2/1

I had a few prophys this week. Those were fine.

I also had a periodic exam to do and I feel like I'm getting more comprehensive with my exams as well as getting faster.

I placed a post this week and I felt very prepared beforehand. However, doing the procedure was very different than preparing for it. Like my class II last week, I was hesitant to work as quickly as I could because of being afraid to perforate the root while taking out the GP. I had a little help from faculty, but overall I feel much more confident now that I went through the procedure.

I had to tx pl with Dr. Soeprono with a patient that had several phases in his tx pl. I saw that I was confused as to how to phase/sequence certain treatments, but Dr. Soeprono walked me through it and I now have a better understanding of phasing while tx planning and why it's so important. I want to be more cognizant of how to phase procedures from now on. Specifically, I was surprised to see that an extraction can be phased as pros (4) and not just disease control (2) based on the comprehensive tx pl.

I had an experience several days ago that I don't think I'll forget anytime soon.  I was doing a 3MOD restoration, but asked the faculty I was working with to swipe a PG endo referral that I had written up with a different faculty.

She had 2 crowns treatment planned and covered by her insurance so I'm trying to find a silver lining in this

I'm beginning to feel like I just need to adjust my expectations for what I will spend the majority of my time doing in clinic.

I had a very interesting case in 1A a few days ago that I'd like to document in this journal.  My patient was a 49 yo male that is makeup artist.  His IOE revealed median rhomboid glossitis and pseudomembranous candidiasis along the hard and soft palate.  He does not wear a denture or smoke. We suspected HIV, but I was displeased with the manner in which the attending faculty discussed the potential infection status with the patient.

These past couple of weeks have been quite a learning experience. I've been doing a few new treatment plans, several with dental complexities. In addition, I have made a few axium mistakes and learned (the hard way) a few new coding policies (continuation of comprehensive exam should always be treatment planned along with the initial comprehensive exam, the right way to treatment plan SRP and perio maintenance, the fact that you can leave notes for individual teeth in the axium odontogram, and that SRP may be indicated even if the probing depths are not over 5 mm). Here are some of the interesting cases I am currently working with:

David Ortiz- 44 y/o male, previous drug abuser, almost edentulous maxilla (4 non restorable teeth with gross decay)
 I started this case with Dr. Lee for a maxillary CD and mandibular RPD, and will now be working with Dr. Jyoshi. We will be making a couple of changes to the RPD, and will no longer need to do survey crowns. The patient is anxious to get the process moving, but can only come on Monday evenings 6-8 PM and couldn't make it the past two weeks.

Luis Mejia- 68 y/o male, high blood pressure controlled with medication
We are considering the ethical dilemma of doing what the patient wants- extract teeth that ARE restorable in favor of a partial denture instead of doing what would be ideally indicated dentally- crowns on all remaining teeth.

Linda Ziering-
Treatment plan in progress. The patient will have an edentulous space on the posterior upper right after treatment so it is interested to think of ways to help the patient maintain quality of life. She has an EXTREMELY strong gag reflex and it was my first time trying to take impressions on a patient with that strong of a gag reflex + a very high palate. She even gagged while taking bitewing xrays. 

Ateeb Hussein- 20 y/o male with high risk for caries
This patient has already had previous extractions and is congenitally missing one premolar from each quadrant. He has several (8) caries into the dentin and spots of demineralization. I strongly emphasized OHI to him and told him that if he changes his dental care habits, he can profoundly save his dental health, especially considering he is so young. I need to prescribe prevident to him at his next appointment as well. He now seems really committed, but probably needs continued encouragement and reinforcement. 

Marlene Browne- high blood pressure, female
Patient has an edentulous space on her mandibular ridge in the area of #30. She would like to consider getting an implant. She also needs a crown on one of her teeth with existing composite but very involved recurrent decay. It should be an interesting case because it will probably be the first crown I work on.

This week, I also worked on an emergency case where a patient came in with a fractured 6 unit temporary dental bridge (#6-11). It was a difficult treatment because fabricated a new temporary bridge doesn't yield any guaruntee that the new one would not crack as well. There just seemed to be too much flexion in the area of the anterior teeth , so the remaining abutment teeth, since the luxatemp matierial is so thin in these areas, cracked regardless. We reinforced the luxatemp material with bonding agent and composite to give it a little more strength and decrease the brittle factor. 

I also went to treatment planning this morning (on accident, because my actual session is apparently not until 9/30). It was a very interesting case though, and I think it reinforces my fascination with periodontistry. It's amazing to me how everything in our field really does depend on the soft tissue and bone surrounding teeth.

This past week has been a whirlwind. Two of my patients referred their friends to me, both who require extensive treatment plans. It was a little stressful because there were several issues with the xray machines almost everyday this week. I will be continuing the treatment planning tomorrow and next week, when hopefully the x ray units are functional again. 

I also experienced my first unpleasant patient interaction over the phone, as I was trying to schedule an appointment with a patient who had been transferred to me by the front desk. Even before meeting me, he requested to see a different student dentist because he preferred a competent male. Although this was a little disheartening at first, I don't take it personally anymore because this was something the patient believed regardless of anything I could do. 

This past week, I also completed 3 restorations and selective SRP on patients. Fortunately, everything went smoothly with all of these procedures. I am also reading up on crown and RPD procedures again, as I will be beginning these procedures in the upcoming weeks. It seems like there was a lot we didn't learn in pre-clinical courses because there are so many dental materials and techniques to be aware of.

Things I am learning about myself:
1) Multitasking is just NOT my forte. I feel like a deer in headlights anytime I have to, because I really need to focus on one thing at a time to do anything effectively. I'm going to try to keep this in mind when I'm preparing for clinic as well.
2) I think I'm really good at the ""assistant"" role, in most circumstances. I've worked a variety of jobs for the past 8 years, since I was 16, and they have all been assistant-type roles. I think this helped me in my work ethic, being able to better deal with different people and personalities, and be able to work in new settings. However, I think it has become part of my nature now, as I am more comfortable being a sidekick, or assistant, or a supporter than to have to be a leader or in the spotlight. I think it might be time to step outside of my comfort zone and try to be more of a leader, because I will need to at least appear as one to be taken 100% seriously.

Every Thursday without skipping a beat, Dr. Polikoff asks ""why are you always so happy?"" in disbelief as he walks past my cubicle. And like a reflex, I always respond ""I'm living the dream"". Honestly, it really is true. This is the dream, every bit of it, from getting [almost] barfed on taking alginate impressions to later getting reprosil stuck throughout a patient's mustache. I'm thankful for the laughs, the craziness, the patients, and most of all, the unity that we have as a clinic that lets us share our triumphs and frustrations with each other. 

In the spirit of Thanksgiving, my absolute favorite holiday, I thought I would write a little about an article I read recently in the NY times.

It describes how you can actually become happier by forcing yourself to think of all the things you are thankful for. For a few years now as part of my morning routine, I make my cup of coffee and think of all of my blessings in life. It helps me carry a lot of positive energy with me throughout my day. It really helps me get through the times where I make mistakes, deal with tough situations, and witness negativity that is outside my control. Of all the things on Earth that we have little control over, I think it is nice to take charge of the things that are within our reach such as our attitudes, punctuality, and spreading good vibes. I hear from a lot of professionals that I'm still in the beginning and that I will inevitably become more jaded with time. I'm not sure about that, but I hope to hold on to my gratitude for as long as I possibly can.

SORRY!! Yes, it has been FIVE weeks since I have updated this beast. Despite this, I think the past 5 weeks have been the most stagnant in terms of the learning curve in clinic. The last few weeks of December, I switched my focus from living and breathing clinic, to trying to pass finals. I also began my pediatric rotation on Thursdays, and it helped me realize that I think pediatric dentistry is absolutely not for me (at least for now). I love working with kids in a variety of settings, but dentistry is just not one of them. It was heartbreaking to see how tormented several of the children were to be in a dental office. I even spoke with some of the faculty who are recent graduates, and their surprisingly bleak view of their day to day professional life did not do much to change my perspective. I think this completes me looking into all the specialties, except endo, and so I feel good about my interest in pursuing general dentistry as my career.

At our recent Dean's New Year Party, I was huddled in the clique known as the rhinos, and we were listening to Dr. Soeprono talk about how in your thirties, everything settles down and life really starts to come together. At the time, I, perhaps appearing a little cocky, responded that I feel like I'm already there. Thinking about it later, I can't say I've changed my mind. Not to say I have it all together (LOL, if only you knew), but I feel like life has really been coming together these past few months in clinic. Perhaps it's because school is much more streamlined and consistent compared to the hectic mess of a schedule I once knew as my life, but I just feel very strongly that this is where I'm meant to be.

What really is success? Is it the dentist that makes the most money? Is it the dentist that is the most loved? Is it the dentist who strikes the perfect work-life balance? I've been thinking a lot about what success really is lately, and what my goals should be in order to be a successful dentist. I think so far, I've concluded that success is ever changing. More about the journey than the destination, I think it's a concept that we are all chasing to help us be the best version of ourselves. Maybe immediately after I graduate, I will define success as being able to pay off my loan or start a practice. Maybe later in my career, it will be more about the work-life balance. Maybe a little later, it will be about trying to ward off ""dentist's hunchback"". Who knows?

On another note, I had oral surgery rotation last week and it ended up actually being...pretty cool. The faculty were pretty nice and understanding, for surgeons that is. I liked that it was fast paced, putting people out of pain, and not about being pretty per se. There was just something about getting down and dirty with relatively caveman instruments to literally just remove a problem that was strangely satisfying. I also got to assist with some interesting implant and sedation cases with the residents. During the week, several faculty and residents were saying I should consider going into surgery, because they thought I was a ""natural"". At the time, I was pretty flattered, and was like ""oh gosh, who ME?!""[acts coy and humble].  Later, when I thought about what they must have seen to make them think that, I think it really just boils down to who they liked working with in the operating rooms. I watched other students assist and saw some who were just completely zoned out, some who were MAJORLY sucking up, and some who were chatterboxes. I definitely made my best attempt to be helpful, less socially awkward [don't know if I succeeded at that one], but stay out of the way when things get serious. This teamwork is probably all it takes to be a ""natural"" in that sort of setting, considering most of the surgeries I watched were more of a team effort. So sadly, no, I'm not special and I'm not naturally gifted with supernatural surgeon hands. But I will take it as reassurance that my attempts at being socially not obnoxious were well received that day.

Clinic has been picking up lately. I recently got a few new patients who were referred from other patients so it's nice to know that some people trust me with their friends and family. I'm also working on my denture cases now, which is a steep learning curve. I'm almost resigned to thinking that the only way to learn how to do something right with dentures is to mess it up at least once first. Even when I read up from the old CR2 manual, it is so different doing VDO/VDR, bite registration, etc on a real person.

Clinic- So I haven't been having very good luck with endo lately. I've started 5 molar endos and have completed...NONE. I still have hope for two of them, but after several appointments spent on 3 of the maxillary first molar endos and then having to resort to referring to the endodontists, my optimism is a little reserved. I think I like what I've been able to do so far with it, but I don't like all of the guesswork involved with possibly missing an MB2, an extra root, not knowing if your working lengths are really and truly accurate, etc. Thank goodness I haven't had any new patient appointments this past week (only saw my regulars), because it was pretty hard to have my usual energy being sick.

Extracurricular- I'm excited to go to the National Oral Health Conference April 18th-20th :) It has been a while since I've been to an academic conference, but from what I remember, they are pretty good at motivating you about whatever the theme is.

Other- I finally have had some time this week to get organized again, because I got a little behind since spring break and being sick for the past week. As much as I love time off from school, it definitely makes me anxious when I come back because I feel like I forgot how to ""adult"".",D3L

I currently do research with Dr. Schmidt and we look at Cancer, Inflammation, and Pain.  I  have completed my first externship at the University of Michigan in March 2016. This was an invaluable experience for me as I learned what really sparked my interest in the field of OMFS. I have now set my mind on pursuing Orthognathic surgery.

Additionally, I was accepted into the Oral Surgery Honors program where I will get an in depth look at the life of an oral surgery.

How can we stay ethical and morally good when only a handful of students who follow these rules are graduating and others have to make shortcuts and find leeways to achieve the same? Most of the times,, it's not that these students are lazy, but just unfortunate with patient selections and management.

Dental school shouldn't be designed to mold students into robot who prep and restore teeth; anyone could do that.

We ask them to defer treatment until it suits ourselves, which could harm the patient as the lesion may progress to further harm the patient. I have overheard at least two students ignore faculty caries check instructions to continue on towards the restorative step, and instead take a hand instrument and expose the pulp, requiring the patient to have unnecessary root canal procedure. 

Frankly, I abhor the dental school run clinics. The point system is overly demanding, requiring students to cut corners on procedures in order to get the most points out of a patient, and some will even sacrifice the ethics taught by the school to achieve points (see the above).

The issue almost always was a lack of communication and feeling like the patient's concerns weren't being heard. Perhaps the most satisfying moment to date for me came when my patient today expressed interest in addressing esthetic concerns.

Following my meeting with Dean Hirsch, I am very excited at the opportunity to expand my clinical experience on our Mexico Outreach.  He assured me that the trip will be worth the time invested and will help us grow clinically/professionally.  With my career goal geared towards community-based dentistry, it would be a great experience to see the dental needs in various parts of the world.",D3L

So far, I've enjoyed learning and gaining clinical experience in Perio., Cariology/Restorative, and Removable Pros.  I have completed 4 quadrants of SRP, looking forward to starting the competency (""A-B-C"") as soon as I find a patient that qualifies.  I've also completed a number of restorations ranging from anterior to posterior teeth.  I think I am very comfortable with restoring large (cavitated/bombed out) teeth.  For removable pros, I have fabricated a flipper for my patient who was missing tooth #8 and started taking impressions for RPD's and CD's for my patients.

I am excited to start my fixed pros (crowns) in the upcoming weeks and also my rotation in Oral Surgery clinic!",D3L

As my education and depth of knowledge expands, I realize how little I actually know, and I am driven to explore more, and find the answers to the questions I didn’t know existed the day before. My natural curiousity will serve me well as  both a clinician and a researcher because I will leave no stone unturned in my quest to arrive at the answer.

I plan to maintain the fundamental qualities all health care practitioners should have; compassion, empathy, professionalism, ethical nature, and put the patient's best interest at the forefront.

Using four handed dentistry with classmates, or D2s that are assisting, requires more than just asking the other person what you need; it's important to be able to communicate so well that the other person is predicting the move of the clinician. Additionally, I have been rotating through the Nurse Practitioner clinic which is an inter-professional program, that brings together myself and a NP student and we do a physical of the patient together, I show the NP student and report my findings of the head and neck exam, and the student does the same with regards to full physical. It feels surreal teaching someone about what I have learned here in the dental program. I am enjoying continuing to learn and I find myself being able to give person centered care, versus just oral health centered care.",D3L
