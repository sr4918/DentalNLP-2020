There are several factors that make a dentist a good professional but I believe one of the most important things for a professional is to be independent and proficient in their job. In other words, professionals should be consistent and punctual. In addition, it is important to follow the rules and regulation to prevent reckless and nefarious malpractices. However, this does not mean that one should be stagnant and passive in their profession. Rather, I believe it is important for professional to actively seek out for improvements and advancements. This can be achieved through working, discussing and researching issues with different professionals in various different fields in the profession. Moreover, it is important for professionals to have appropriate moral and ethical standards. I believe these are some of the factors that are crucial in becoming a good professional.",D2L

It is, thus natural, that I have vast interest in becoming an orthodontist. However, I would like to be exposed to a various different dental specialties not only through school curriculum but also through community outreach and volunteer service. As a dental student, I would like to graduate dental school in good standing with proficiency in general dentistry. As a health care professional, I would like to learn not only the technical skills but also the interpersonal skills to have fulfilling relationships with various different patients. I realize this skill would require me to uphold my ethical principles as well as the rules and regulation at all times. Moreover, I hope that I would be more open-minded and bold in making decisions. In addition, I would like to have a good lifelong relationship with my peers in both private and professional environment.",D2L

D2 started off very similar to D1 in terms of course load and simulation lab requirements.  However, once February 2015 came, it felt like there was a never-ending parade of competencies, practicals and exams.  Through all of this, I felt like my knowledge base has grown significantly.  I especially liked the simulation lab courses of CR1 and CR2, where I learned more complex tooth preparations and restorations, as well as how to properly produce a CD as well as various RPDs. Over the course of the D2 year, I feel that my drilling and restorative abilities have continued to significantly improved, especially to the point where I feel very comfortable if I had to utilize any of these techniques on my future patients.  I am very excited, as well as nervous, to be entering clinic, but I feel it will be a fun challenge. The knowledge that I gained from my first 2 years will definitely be a building block for my future courses and hopefully will stick with me as I wait to take the NBDE I in August.",D2L

I know that sounds kind of vague, and I haven't found a better way to express that just yet, but what I mean is to fix whatever facial deformities or defects that are present. My pre-dental society in undergrad would have dental health professionals speak every week and I remember one in particular where he should photos of people that had to wear facial prosthetics to cover what were essentially parts of their face or jaw missing. At the time I thought the very fact a prosthodontist could make something and give it to the patient to wear was amazing. But what I really want to do is go one step beyond that and make wearing the prosthetic unnecessary. Facial reconstruction is I think the coolest thing. From what I know I think leans heavily toward OMS and bigger hospital surgeries which I rather prefer than private practice. When we talk about improving quality of life, I believe there is no greater way to increase that than down this path.",D2L

One particular article sticks out in my mind whenever I think of professionalism and what it means. The article talked about ""civic professionalism"" and how there is an inherent contract, or trust, between the public and the professional. And moreover, we as professionals should give back to the community for without the community providing patients how would we have learned our craft. I think that as I progress throughout dental school this will become more relevant and I know whatever opportunity I have to give back or do a community outreach I will try my best to make it happen.

I've worked with dental professionals from around the United States, Mexico, and Australia and have a strong sense of what I want to get out of dentistry -- I simply want to be able to fix people's faces. To me,  a person's face is their most important feature giving them the self-confidence to go out and interact with the world.

This not only includes completing the course work, but also pushing myself to study and learn outside the boundaries of the curriculum to become a health care professional that is able to cooperate and coordinate with others. One thing that I have learned about dental school is that you only get out of it what you put into it, and I want to put my best effort into it.

Serving even my peers brings me joy, so I will continue to strive my best to seek as much wisdom and advice to provide the best quality care.

The dilema was to let someone else clean their teeth professionally before the patient comes in so it appears that they have been persuaded into doing it themselves.

It was important for us to work together because as aspiring dentists, these ethical values hold an important part of our foundation as a dentist.

The former is necessary because without a solidified background regarding these sciences, one may not be able to deliver proper oral healthcare.  The first year covered many courses, such as anatomy, physiology, and neuroscience.  The second year covered more pathology and diagnosis of certain oral conditions.

It has been very difficult to plan anything out more than 1 week in advance, as my energy has been needed to micromanage school activities on a daily basis. I can't believe the exam schedule is set well, with ample time to prepare for each exam, and professors generally do not do enough to adequately prepare us (answer questions in emails, etc.). I also vehemently do not believe the grading policy has been consistent, fair, nor unbiased in CR1, which is very frustrating considering the scope and magnitude of the course.

Sensitivity involves the deliberate action of attempting to understand other viewpoints or situations, not just the identification of differences. Making wise and rational decisions under stressful situations defines self-control. The ability to build and maintain friendly and stimulating relationships, whilst considering differences in culture and values displays tact and diplomacy. Integrity is the competency of fighting for the principles and beliefs, even in situations where it is difficult to do so. Through the assessment of situations in defining the problem, judgmental analysis is exhibited through critical analysis, prioritization, and creativeness. To be conscientiousness, the professional needs to be enthusiastic and committed to the love for dentistry.

With that being said, I tend to have poor eating and sleeping habits due to the energy spent for my schoolwork, let alone the labs and deadlines I have to meet.  The occasional e-mail about updating my personal statement only adds to the immense stress that my body suffers already.  I have eosinophilic esophagitis, GERD, and chronic gastritis.  The only time my symptoms subside are when I am on break from school, and the symptoms immediately come back the second I am reminded that I have to reflect on how stressed I have been during school.  I am a very introspective person and I reflect a lot on myself.  I take pictures and use them as a guide for self-improvement.  The fact that I have to share it with NYU makes me feel that it is NOT so personal anymore.  The road I have taken to get to where I am IS indeed very personal to me, and I feel violated sharing it with people whom I know very superficially.  I really do hope that this updated statement will suffice until I graduate, when perhaps my thoughts are different and I have reached the level of success that I am comfortable with.  However, just to satisfy the desires of this ""portfolio program"" I will share a quote that I find important for success: ""There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to be better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter.

Understanding this allows one to be a true professional and excel in their care for an individual. The five basic ethical principles; veracity, justice, autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, are integral to the way a dentist should practice and acts as a guide to being a professional. Being truthful to the patient is one of the main things one can do as a healthcare provider; being fair is part of the oath we take, to not discriminate against who we treat; allowing the patient their own rights to their treatment is allowing them the right to make their own decisions and show that we are respectful of that; doing good for the patient is a defining role any healthcare provider has; and finally doing no harm is understanding that we are in control of informing the patient of their well being and we should not harm them in any way with treatments or any other matter.

It is also important to express empathy towards the patient so they feel comfortable in the environment and so they can gain trust in their healthcare provider. A professional should maintain respect for their patients and hold themselves with integrity. Self assessment is a critical component in becoming a competent professional since it allows one to see where they were and how much they have progressed. It also allows one to realize that there is always more room to grow and it allows one to add on to the list of what they find the most valuable.

Again, proper and effective communication in a professional manner is going to be a key to success as a competent, reliable health practitioner. I am realizing that the way in which I communicate to a colleague is different than how I communicate to a patient.

Being presented with this award really makes me believe that the challenges we face everyday are overcome with a lot of dedication, motivation and hard effort. I didn't have the greatest academic performance in undergrad and that really impacted how confident I felt commencing dental school. This achievement of mine has really made me gain more confidence in myself which I feel I may lack at times. Having this sense of confidence and believing in my abilities will help me progress further into my professional career as I start seeing patients.",D2L

Personally I don't think I am ready because there are a lot that school didn't teach us. I look forward to clinic but at the same time little bit scared. I know I will face different kindf of patients, faculties, and cases.

I have seen that all patients differ in their comfort levels and how they feel about dentistry in general. I've also had the opportunity to network with younger dentists who are only a few years out of school and it seems as though some dentists over-diagnose their patients and push for procedures that have monetary benefit to them. This is completely unethical and something I will definitely be on the look out for when I'm accepting a job as an associate my first few years out. At NYU, I am learning to treat patients with integrity and thorough care, and thats how I want to continue to practice when I'm out on my own.",D2L

Even when the days seem long and we might be tired or frustrated, it's important to remain mentally strong and always push through. Every patient, whether it is the patient scheduled at 8am or at 8pm, deserves our full effort and attention. Professionalism to me means that I vow to learn as much as I possibly can. I want to be able to provide world class dental care to a very specific niche of patients who seek and appreciate this level of care. Starting my dental career here at NYU, exposing myself to practically every culture and personality, gives me confidence in my ability to one day create my own brand of dentistry that encompasses my vision for extraordinary care.",D2L

I feel as though I received an excellent clinical foundation and feel competent in my abilities to successfully prepare and restore various class preparations.

6/29/15: After my first month in the clinic, I've treated several patients and have learned more and gained more confidence exponentially.

I need to be quick and experienced in saying phrases such as ""Administration assigned me to be your new provider"" when the truth is ""You failed to show up and the other dental student's schedule is full, and I am free instead"" or being extremely professional on the phone; I read the 'Dental Language Guide' book and it has helped as a guideline on how to communicate. Managing to exude confidence and professionalism drives me to re-look at notes, so the information is fresh in my mind and I have little reason to doubt myself. Personally, I realize I have an issue in understanding how to interact with authority (faculty) because I have the feeling ""I hate to bother them"", but I think I am feeling more comfortable in communicating with them especially as the pace of clinic makes me push that feeling aside as I've got to get signed off; if I have extra questions though, they die off with the worry of bothering them.",D2L

I know that GDS lab has prepared me to the best of my ability to enter clinic but I am also anxious about things such as using the perio tools, which I feel like we didn't get appropriate practice with.

We havent been told this is something we have to do for our patients, but isnt it right to practice a procedure before we do that procedure on a human for the first time? is it ethical to avoid calling a patient who has a reputation of being mean? it is natural, but it is not really the right thing to do, everyone needs care and it isnt fair to judge a patient just based on a reputation. Is it ethical to let someone steal your chair in clinic? does that not set a bad precedent? does that mean that they have a patient more important than yours?

Although this was what I had expected of myself originally. I have also volunteered on several outreaches in underserved communities, and this has paid of by me getting many patients!

While I have been very satisfied with my GDS results, my results in the other classes have been sub-average; albeit passing. This was frustrating until I accepted it. Living an hour north with a family and 2 children has its consequences, and although I strive to get a 100 on every test, my time management is vastly different from that of a single student living within proximity to the school. 

Having said that, I will continue to try and get better, and hopefully D2 will prove to be a drastically better year in all aspects.",D2L

Not discriminating against anyone and being sensitive and aware of the patients needs. I would never want to work in a situation where I thought I wasn't doing what is best for the patient. I want to treat them as I would want to be treated. I think that ethics at NYUCD is very important and I'm starting to realize this more as I work in the clinic. I feel like I want to treat the patient the best I can but at the same time have to follow NYU protocol. It is hard to satisfy my patients when there isn't a lot of time and also when we have to go through so many steps to get something done. This is a struggle I am dealing with as I'm starting to see people and hope I get used to this with time and learn how to treat my patients and suit my ethical standards that are constantly on my mind in the clinic.,D2L

I am continuing to make progress now while starting to work on patients in the clinic. This is a true test of my competency as a professional, especially suiting their needs while still complying with NYUCDs standards of care.

26,WKtLvsDc,Public Self Reflection,25-05-15 19:52,19.86666667,"Becoming a professional means to be competent and skillful at a particular speciality. As a future dentist, this requires me to be a diligent student, partaking in community service outreaches and participating in leadership opportunities. Networking and interacting with colleagues is not only fun, but essential in providing optimal healthcare. Dentists no longer work alone, they interact with their patients and doctors of other specialty to coordinate treatment plan catered to their patients. Also, is it important that dentists carry a sense of public interest and contributing good to society. These all come with the traits of high moral integrity and ethics. These are some of the traits I hope to enhance upon throughout my dental school career to aid me become a professional.",D2L

To accomplish this, I hope to build critical skills such as: (a) Communicate across a wide variety of people from different backgrounds (b) Master techniques (c) Knowledgeable about new technology (d) Continuously strive for quality (e) Maintain ethical behavior (f) Think critically and (g) Promote/educate importance of oral health and it's relation to overall health.",D2L

I have been honing my hand skills for roughly two years and have noticed an amazing transition in my ability to work in the mouth. I will soon be seeing patients and will be granted the privilege to treat real patients. This is both an exciting and intimidating period for me but I feel confident in being able to identify and manage cases that I'm capable of handling and those that I know will be slightly outside of my scope. It motivates me to continue to improve both my hand skills and knowledge so that I can provide the best possible care to the patients who put their trust in my ability to treat them.,D2L

In order to do this, I should develop my professional confidence and competency as well as learn to be a leader among my coworkers.

1,QGvQF4Ls,Ethic Reflection,11-05-15 19:07,19.11666667,"Why cheat? Is getting access to previous years exam considered cheating. Obviously people having access to these files will have an advantage over others who do not. But then students who have an late lab or an practical right before an major exam will be put on a disadvantage. One thing I learned during my first year is with the huge number of students in our class it is nearly impossible to create an equal and fair setting for every student. And sometimes this makes it so hard to decide whether some acts are considered cheating or not. It will be a good idea to talk about what specific act will be considered cheating during orientation
Sometimes we get emails from professors that they have observed cheating going on and are disappointed. They also say there will be punishment next time and don't expect us to be cheating. This makes absolutely no sense. I just laugh when I get these types of email. Why not punish the act in the first time. If they let go of cheating the first time, wouldn't it be fair to let others cheat at least once? For sure, it won't be fair for somebody to get caught cheating because they were ""warned"" while the person who cheated in the very beginning will just get off with a warning.
My perception to ethics has gradually changed, not anyone can have the same standard and especially when we have so many students it is impossible to be fair and define 'ethic'.",D2L
2,QGvQF4Ls,Private Personal,11-05-15 19:03,19.05,"I did not do my best during my undergrad and I have always regretted since graduating. I do not want to repeat my mistakes during dental school. During my four years in dental school I will try my best to study. For now, during orientation week, my goal in to be in the top 20% of the class. Hopefully I will be able to achieve this and will be able to aim higher as time passes. At the same time, I do not want to become overly competitive. I would want to learn how to collaborate and able to provide and receive peer assessment.

To be honest as time passes I am no longer eager to get a good grade to satisfy myself. I am leaning towards general dentistry and do not want to be stressed about the grades too much. However, I will continue to do my best in classes to help myself become a competent dentist.

I am finding out that at least for me, crown preps and dentures are easier and more fun compared to just prep and fill. I am starting to be a little more interested in protho.
Esthetic dentsistry is fun but I want to be get more exposure to the business side of the dentsistry since my goal is to open a practice as soon as I can",D2L

Every time before the exam or quiz instructors  yell out that no cheating will be tolerated but still I hear lots of incidence of cheating happening.
Sometimes these episodes make me feel like I am getting disadvantaged by not cheating and this has made me think a lot.
However I made up my final decision that grades are not the mist important aspect in dental school. I will try my best and will focus more in what will help me become a better progressional.

I'm doing my best to become a professional on all aspect. I try my best to finish all my work on time help my peers if I am able to and also try not to just sit and study all day long.",D2L

For me this was a totally different experience since I am not used to being part of a large group.
Learning how to interact with different type do person will further help me become a better professional.

D2 so far is a lot harder and time consuming compared to last year. I think I learned how to manage my time and make sure that I finish lab work.

I am starting to enjoy more of lab portion of the school. I am getting better grades than I did in GDS. I will continue to work hard and improve on my hand skills
Also, esthetic course has helped me become a more detailed person which I think is a important trait to becoming a good clinician",D2L

With the skills I obtain from dental school I want to help the people who live in the underserved area who can not get easy access to a dentist. I grew up with a bad oral condition and know how miserable it is to live with such bad oral condition. Hopefully I will learn how to effectively communicate with the patients and will be able to help them confidently smile in front of others. Also, during my four years in dental school I want to make many life long colleagues that I will be able to keep in touch for a long time.

As my first year is ending I had a chance to look back and reflect. I was too busy keeping up with school work that I completely forgot about the real reason I wanted to become a dentist. I still want to become a dentist that can have a positive effect in the community and provide service to those whom who are less fortunate. I will try to get involved in more community service during this summer and my D2 years

Almost half way through D2, we are doing more lab work that is related to dentistry. Being exposed to different types of dentistry was a good experience for me. For now, I am enjoying every aspect of dentistry except for pediatrics. We will have more pediatric outreach and lectures coming up next semester so I will see if anything changes.

Ethics to me, at this stage is important for growing as student and future clinician. If I do not study and learn the material now, odds are I will not be  learn it later (which is why I can't understand why so many people cheat). I consider myself a pretty honest person and student and cannot believe the hoops we jump through at NYU to take an exam, especially when I have friends in other medical schools who take their exams in a computer lab by themselves at a time of their choice.

However, considering the time and financial expenses that are going into becoming a professional at an institution such as dental school, why not master it? Squeeze as much information into your head, try to strive for the perfect score on that practical, and never satisfy by becoming the last.

I'm not saying that this will lead to a decline in quality/level of service you'll provide, or that you'll end up engaging in unethical behavior, but it certainly is a slippery slope.

It was interesting how many of us act a certain way when we're with friends and colleagues but completely different when we're in front of patients. In a way though, it's necessary, as when you're with a patient, you're expected to be not just a student, but a care provider. I can see that a lot of us have matured, myself included.

It was a wonderful experience that I was able to share with my peers and family that day, as well as my friends via live stream. Since that day I've been asked numerous times by friends and family how it feels to ""finally be a doctor"". As I reflected on the symbolic nature of the ceremony, transitioning from didactic coursework to entering into clinic and beginning to treat patients, with real saliva and real teeth that we can't unscrew and check outside of their mouthes- I began feeling very excited. A year and a half of dental school and years of hopes and aspirations beginning to come to fruition suddenly felt tangible. The oath we took at the ceremony- reminding us why we're here, what the past year and a half had been for, what the next two and a half years will mean and what we have to remind ourselves of once we are on our own. Professionally, I would say I have taken another step forward and I'm looking forward to the future.",D2L
