In treating patients, I will learn about the community around me so that I can be culturally sensitive and empathetic. I will also stick to a code of ethics that I will hold myself to. These will include putting my patient's desires, and health and oral health above my own personal desires. I will always provide my patients with all their options so that they may be able to make the best decision for their oral health based on their limitations and their understanding. I will always document my procedures and any important events that occur during my patient's visit, so that I can legally protect myself and themselves, and so that the work is documented for future review.

I will also learn the processes behind these diseases, and how to treat them. In the clinic, I will learn about the characteristics of each teeth, how to restore them via crowns, fillings, or root canals, how to remove caries, how to make complete and partial dentures and how to create models and impressions for studying a patient's mouth or for preparing crowns or retainers. I will also learn how to interact with patients in terms of explaining procedures to them in words they can understand, in a manner that is respectful, and in a empathetic and ethical way (putting the patient's health and wants above my own personal desires). Finally, I hope to learn from my colleagues and practice communicating and working together with them.

However I will not limit myself to these specialties and I will explore other areas of specialty. I will also be satisfied with being a general dentist as well. Ultimately though, it depends on what I find I enjoy the most. I would also like to open my own clinic or at least have a clinic with another associate, especially because of the ease of accessibility to another dentist's opinion. Finally, I will strive to treat all my patients with respect, and all my colleagues with gratification and respect. I will try to be patient with patients that can be difficult to communicate with or patients who may have different ideologies than myself.

I will also constantly challenge myself to better my work, by self-assessing myself often and checking on past work to see if anything should be redone. As a professional, I will strive for clear and concise communication with the patient and with my colleagues. I will also attempt to ensure that all my patients understand the importance of oral hygiene to overall health and the various ways they can take care of their teeth and health.

11,Q3KOrarY,Professional Progress,15-09-15 1:13,1.216666667,"After my second year of dental school and entering my third year, I've learned much more about how the oral cavity can reflect diseases in the body or how the oral cavity can be affected because of other changes occurring in the patient's body. I've learned how to work with another student as a dental assistant and vice versa, learning more about team effort. I've learned the steps and processes needed in creating a complete and a removable partial denture. I've also learned how to prepare crowns and bridges as well as make temporary crowns and bridges. I've learned more about how to interact with patients and now that I am in clinic, I am starting to understand how to communicate with my patients in a way that shows professionalism and competence while still being a student at the school. I also learned how to give local anesthesia to my patients in the form of nerve blocks and infiltrations, how to perform a comprehensive exam and x-rays, prophylaxis, scaling and root planing, and simple restorations.

I will learn to treat patients both in the short-term and long-term capacity. I will also strive to treat all my patients with respect, sympathy, and ethically. I will always put the patient's health and desires above any personal gain, and I will be sure to refer my patient's to other doctors or dentists if I do not feel able to complete a procedure. I will practice my communication skills and being honest with my patients. I will practice my own skills so that I am competent and able to serve others well.

I finally get to apply the knowledge that i've gained in my D1 and D2 years, as well as gain new knowledge and tips/tricks from the D4s and various faculties.  When I first started in clinic I was very nervous and unsure of how I would be able to deal with treating my patients.  Now that I have been in clinic for just over 2 months, I feel more comfortable and competent in my abilities.  The majority of my treatments to date have been SRPs, and I feel like I know how to efficiently and properly complete these procedures.  I have also already completed 1 of my SRP competencies and successfully passed.  I have also got more confident and steady in terms of delivering LA to my patients vs. when I first started in clinic.

18,USOSSVQW,Ethic Reflection,09-07-15 16:46,16.76666667,"I will most likely run into many instances where I would have to make a decision based on my ethical values. I heard that some dentists would prep a tooth that does not need to be prepped, then later they would recommend RCT, then the crown, or even implants. Economically speaking, it is the most efficient way to make profit. With one tooth, we can potentially make thousands of dollars. But that's not why I'm here. My ultimate goal is to practice in underserved countries while I maintain an office in the States so that I can provide resources for myself to help those in need. In order to achieve this, I should evaluate my own actions constantly and that I won't fall into the temptations that many unethical dentists fall into.",D3F
19,USOSSVQW,Private Personal,09-07-15 16:23,16.38333333,"Last two years at dental school was the most difficult time of my life. After having some relationship problems right before getting in, I felt like I was only going downhill regardless of what was going on at school. The first year I think at least I tried hard to keep up with school. Then the second year started when my depressive thoughts flipped its switch and turned into massive anxiety. The cause is still not clear to me, and I really hated myself for being so mentally weak. I honestly think I have never been so vulnerable in my entire life. I would put off studying until the last minute, and the grades reflected my unstable mental state. I dreamed of being an oral surgeon since I was in 10th grade in high school, but somehow I felt so lost all of a sudden. Thankfully, I still passed the second year and now I'm in clinic. Dealing with patients and listening to their stories have been an eye-opening experience for me, helping me realize once again why I am here.",D3F

To think of all the things to come in the future, I do feel a little overwhelmed. How will I start my practice? Will I even be able to graduate without any problems? Questions like these constantly bother my mind, but even after spending a month in the clinic I can see myself adapting more and more to the environment. Yes, I am still not competent, but I believe in myself that I can only get better. I don't want to be just a dentist. I want to be my patients' friend, counselor, someone who they can fully trust. I want to change the perspective of the general public towards dentists, but I would first have to train myself to be competent in what I do. I hope that over the next two years I would gain more confidence and treat my patients with gentle heart.",D3F
21,USOSSVQW,Public Self Reflection,09-07-15 16:32,16.53333333,"As I started seeing more patients, I realize how unprepared I am. Even though I have learned all the things we should know as dentists, I feel like sometimes I cannot provide comprehensive care for my patients. Dealing with patients changed my perspective on dentistry, and now that the board exam is coming up, I have more responsibility inside that I want to know as much as possible to become a competent dentist. The other day, a patient came in with benign prostate hyperplasia, and I was able to have a conversation with him about the disease and the medications associated with the disease. If I had had no idea what the patient was talking about, I would have appeared as nothing but an untrustworthy student. There is still a lot more for me to learn, but now that I feel this growing responsibility, I will strive to be a competent professional whom my patients can trust.",D3F
22,USOSSVQW,Professional Progress,09-07-15 16:52,16.86666667,"After starting clinic, the sense of professionalism grew. It's not about getting my lab work signed by a faculty anymore. Each work is done in a patient's mouth, and I can see myself trying my best to do a good job on the patients. Even though they may not see exactly what I am doing in their mouths, I feel obliged to do the procedures at my best abilities. I have only done some restorative procedures only in the clinic, but as I get exposed to other cases I will feel more competent.",D3F
23,USOSSVQW,Public Personal,09-07-15 16:11,16.18333333,"Over the last two years at NYUCD, I learned what it takes to be a dentist. It was definitely more than what I initially expected; from back to back exams to labs requiring numerous work, I almost feel like I've become a different person now. Along with the knowledge I gained, I was able to cope with stress. As I started clinic, I started to feel more like I'm actually in this journey of becoming a dentist. I didn't think I would find myself having ""fun"" as I dealt with patients. I guess it was all worth it in the end after digging through notes for the last two years, and I feel more responsible for the knowledge I should maintain.",D3F
24,UT8VFDpf,Ethic Reflection,09-09-15 22:14,22.23333333,"To become ethical, one must first be able to know what is right and what is wrong.  And then, after know what is right and what is wrong, one must understand the appropriate actions following the determination.  It takes knowledge, experience, and courage to become truly ethical, and I aspire to become a great dentist that could deliver this to my future patients.  

I definitely learned a lot about the ethical work that being a dentist requires.  There are just so many ways to cut corners in dentistry that ethics can become a very critical issue in the entire system of health care delivery.

Looking back at what I wrote 2 years, ago, I find that surprisingly, I also felt about the ways that dentists can mistreat patients from the beginning, and it is sometimes hard to judge what is right and what is wrong because of deadlines, expectations and such.  But somehow I felt like after treating these patients, the best way is to really let your patients like you, and then they will do their best to accommodate for whatever treatment you're doing, whether it's delayed or whatever.",D3F
25,UT8VFDpf,Private Personal,09-09-15 22:08,22.13333333,"When I was young, I was scared of going to dentists because I am fearful. As I grow up, I learn more and more about this world to understand that danger is real, but fear is just an illusion that we create spontaneously to help ourselves overcome the obstacles.  I am very interested in the fear aspect of dentistry, and I would love to spend the next four years in NYUCD not only studying dentistry and perfecting my clinical skills, but also learn how to properly manage others' as well as my fear.

Now 2 years have passed and I really learned a lot, especially upon entering clinic.  I learned to deal with all kinds of pressures from patients, faculties and clinic personnel, and learning how to provide the best outcome so that everyone is satisfied.  I think when I graduate from NYU I will be more competent to work in the real world ~  I love this experience, everyday I learn so much from hands on work.",D3F

Someday when I can talk to the patients and guide them in my treatment the same way I have learned in school, especially in ethics class, then maybe I will be more professional than before.

I think there are so many ways to really do harm and mistreat patients, due to all kinds of factors such as pressures from lab, from patients' family, etc...   I think professionalism is to find a way to really provide the best outcome for patient's benefit, to do what is best for the patient while not compromising too much.",D3F
27,UT8VFDpf,Professional Progress,09-09-15 22:26,22.43333333,"Professionalism is really stressed in this school and I think it is definitely having an effect on student body.  As the time comes and we all move into the clinic I am sure there will be more time to mature and progress in terms of professionalism.

Now that I have entered clinic, I think it's really important to observe if the patient likes a professional dentist that lectures constantly or just wants someone who is professional while working.  There's a big difference between both, and I think it really affects patient's mood as well.",D3F
28,UT8VFDpf,Public Personal,09-09-15 22:10,22.16666667,"I still remember in my personal statement for dental school application, I wrote a story about how a little boy was frightened to go to the dentists.  But 15 years later, this little boy is a grown man and started learning all the knowledge that is required to become a competent dentist.  I wish that after four years of school, I can step out of NYUCD being confident to treat patients, and to grow up to become a respected and compassionate dentist like my parents, whom I admire and aspire to.

2 years have passed and I learned so much from didactic courses, and now it's finally the real deal ! I really hope that when I graduate from NYU, I wouldn't be anxious the night before treating patients haha.",D3F
29,UTEyCtqiIA==,Ethic Reflection,16-09-15 9:04,9.066666667,"Ethical values are unique to dental professionals because dentists have a ""special"" role in the communities they participate in.  Dentists form a trusting relationship which their patients and with their community and therefore have a powerful position both socially and ethically.  This empowered position may serve as a struggling point for many professionals because it gives them a sense of entitlement and  limitless boundaries.

This not only includes completing the course work, but also pushing myself to study and learn outside the boundaries of the curriculum to become a health care professional that is able to cooperate and coordinate with others. One thing that I have learned about dental school is that you only get out of it what you put into it, and I want to put my best effort into it. I hope to become a dentist with an influence that is larger than the confines of the office, and is highly involved in local and regional outreach programs.

An example would be if a patient would like to get a particular procedure done and we know that it would fail for any number of reasons, it would be best to stick to our professional judgement of not doing the procedure, rather than trying to please the patient. I have noticed that some patients really try to pressure you into doing something that you may not want to do, or pressure you into making the procedure go faster, but it is important for us to take our time and follow all of the steps to avoid making any possible mistakes.

I have also thought about oral surgery, but I'm not so sure that I want to be in school for an addition six years after dental school. Now I am currently thinking about going into orthodontics or periodontics, because I can't see myself being satisfied with being a general dentist. I have also thought about going into academia and teaching at a dental school when I graduate; however as of now I think I would like to practice.

The research that I might want to do after dental school if I end up becoming a professor would be on oral cancer treatments.

One thing that I've been continuously trying to do was to focus on the patient's well-being and empathy towards them even in rather confusing and hectic moments of adapting to the clinic. I believe I will have to continuously remind myself to keep putting the patient as the first priority, throughout my career even beyond the school. Another thing that really struck me throughout the first few months is the importance of comprehensive and thorough treatment planning. Before actually seeing patients, I thought that technicality was the major part of patient care.

Often times, we would have upperclassmen share previous exams and study sheets and it was our decision to distribute them to create a level playing ground when it was exam day. During second year, we saw many of our classmates going to all distances to succeed on practicals and competencies, whether that meant bringing pre-prepared teeth or drilling outside the mouth. It was up to us whether we approach our classmates and challenge their moral standards.",D3F

I do my first endo case this Tuesday. Mildly anxious, though I've reviewed the notes and shadowed a few. I have to remind myself that this is a learning environment, that as a student not every procedure will be perfect; do the best you can, and if you make a mistake, just fix it, learn from it, it's not the end of the world.

I need better time management skills. I feel like I'm often rushed towards the end of the tx, then I start to panic, and in the midst of getting swipes and writing notes, sometimes forget critical things.

Another thing that became more important was professional conduct in front of colleagues and faculty, as well as patients. We cannot succeed alone in clinic; we need mentors and peer support, and learning from senior students and faculty is the fastest way to becoming proficient.

Being ethical means that before you're honest with the public, you should be honest with yourself. By not learning and getting your way through school doing the bare minimum and relying on others to help you do what is your homework, you are going to reach the clinic in third year lacking a lot of skills that your colleagues will have. Of course many people have many different views on what is ethical and what is not, but there are some universal commonalities that everyone in the right state of mind will define as ethical vs unethical. Cheating on tests for example is very unethical. Lying to your patients for your personal benefit is very unethical as well.

In the profession of dentistry, being professional means you have to approach your problems in a way that is patient centred; they are the priority. It also means that you should be able to apply what you learn in lectures and pre clinic and apply it in the clinic. Being a professional also means being a leader.

However, ethics can sometimes mean working in a gray area that is neither black nor white. This requires a state of mind that provides good judgment in deciding the balance between right and wrong, right and more right, or the lesser of two evils. The goal of being ethically aware is to act accordingly and appropriately. An example of ethics in dentistry is to know when to refer out because of one's limitations and weaknesses in doing certain procedures. This is a difficult task for some individuals because ego can give them a false sense of confidence. On the other hand, practicing dentistry also means to venture out of one's comfort zone slightly in order to grow clinically and to become a better dentist. While the risks and rewards of practicing dentistry must be assessed, it is important to keep the patient's best interest as a top priority.",D3F

Since then, however, my faith in God had diminished for whatever reasons and I stopped going to church due to the extreme demands of dental school. I feel like I am a changed person, but I'm not sure if it's for the better. Initially, I thought that the New York experience would allow me to improve my interpersonal skills by teaching me how to handle diversity, but I somewhat feel indifferent to it all, as my primary goal now is to balance schoolwork with family. My jobs are to be a hardworking student, loving husband, and wise father of two, so I have enough on my plate.

I watched Dr. Montouri and learned that sometimes I just have to keep on going and have them bear with it; I need to work on being firm and assertive. Ideally I'd like the patient to be as comfortable as possible, so when they're in pain, I have to learn when there's something I can do about it or not.

Being a professional involves possessing the correct knowledge to share with your patients in a respectful and effective manner.

I am also concerned with how people treat patients. I recognize that the school puts pressures on us. In order to graduate on time we have MDR requirements and certain number of CEEs to complete. I do think we must think of patients first. It's not ethically sounds to see a patient as CEEs before seeing the patient as a person first. 

In addition, I think that nonmaleficence, first do no harm should also have environmental considerations. I think as responsible health care profressionals we should also be educated on the impact of our work on the environment. Environmental health impacts our patients health. The waste and materials used in dentistry should be more critically looked at to ensure we are not doing harm to our current and future patients.",D3F

Since then I have felt like I had more of an interest in faculty practice and oral medicine. I do not intend on doing a general practice residency so I think faculty practice would act almost as a mini residency to allow me to see many patients in a single day and allow me to increase my speed and efficiency when treating patients. I have an interest in oral medicine as I have gained a lot of respect for the faculty that run the elective as they have been great professors in OMPR and General Pathology. I also have a history of cancer in my family and feel like I would be good empathizing with patients who have a suspicious lesion and have come in for a biopsy.
 I have looked into pediatrics as I completed 6 month clinic observation at Bellevue. I do however think this may be something I consider after I have practiced for a few years. Due to financial constraints and anxiousness to get out of school and get into practice, I will put this off and reevaluate in a few years whether it is something I would like to commit to.",D3F
67,UNeX45gI,Private Self Reflection,20-11-15 21:33,21.55,I find the greatest challenge for me in my best attempt to be a professional is my nervousness and cautious nature when it comes to treating patients. I am not at my best if I don't feel confident and it is really challenging to feel confident when you're trying to complete a task you have only done once or twice before. I don't think nervousness and professional go hand in hand. A patient needs to feel like they trust in their doctor and if they aren't confident in themselves how can they be confident in the doctor? I have overcome this with really developing strong relationships with my patients. I think they understand that I am very knowledgeable and that I am cautious as I do not want to make a mistake (and this stems from my interest in offering them the best possible care) and through this they are able to have trust in me. I would much prefer if I could be confident in myself and be able to stay calm during a procedure but that will come with time and experience. I am confident that my nervousness will be reduced with time as it has already reduced in the passing months.,D3F

The definition of a professional is simple to state but really challenging to follow through on with every single patient in every single circumstance. Some days are harder than others, you're frustrated, you have challenges outside of the clinic that are on your mind.

I started getting used to the way the clinic works and how axium works. I saw/felt what caries is. I learned (and am still learning) how to correctly identify caries based on the ICDAS system.
I learned that a restoration needs to be redone if the explorer 'sticks' by the margins of the restoration. I also learned that, based on color, you can have a 'leaky' restoration even if the margins seem to be in-tact (I'm still not so clear on this). But if the margins have a tight seal and the radiograph shows a radiolucency under the restoration, we need to think about what this might be other than caries.
I also learned how to cut off a crown when it becomes locked on a tooth (Dr. Moghadam was kind enough to sit and do it with me).

I learned that grinding/clenching can be a cause of widened PDL and not automatically an endo problem.

A good practice should be founded on those principles in order to best serve the needs of the patients.

I think while we have this ethical responsibility to the patient, they also have some sort of ethical responsibility to us to tell us the whole truth. Some patients clearly don't floss and come to clinic lying about flossing. However, I do believe as a good dentist, I should teach them the proper OHI and flossing so they can do it in case they want to change. It is for their own good and maybe it won't help now, but may help down the road.",D3F

I also know that being a professional takes time, and that I have a long way to go before I even fully understand what being a professional really means.

I think it's true that as professional as I want to be, some patients are uncooperative and I'm learning to distinguish when they are being unreasonable and when I could improve myself in some areas. I think it's definitely a learning process. Some patients will just trust me right away, sit down and open their mouths and let me do whatever to their teeth. Others are shopping around or have this initial impression of NYU which is hard to break. Still others come in thinking this school is there to give them just a cleaning and expect me to do it without a treatment plan.

However, I do understand that it takes time to build trust amongst the patients and that maybe some patients are not as cooperative. I just want to be the most professional I can be, so that I know I did my best to treat patients both ethically and clinically.

I've learned a lot about professionalism through interacting with patients in the clinic in D3. For example, first impressions make a big difference and some patients are just more trusting than others.

Treatment planning became a bit easier and I am learning more and more from the faculty each day. I guess the most exciting part is actually doing the procedure and seeing how to make an access or prep. It was really a long way to go before I truly become proficient.

Course directors should expect that their exams will be released, that students have all old exams. To do otherwise can not but strike me as lazy. The ultimate result of full exam distribution will no doubt be a library of a few hundred questions for each major exam in each subject.

      It felt great to pass the boards, hard to say if that celebration is cooled a bit knowing everyone passed, makes it seem less special somehow, even so, it was a very difficult exam. I'm far more enthusiastic about the 2nd two years of dental school than I was about the first. Aside from the thrill of being in clinic and treating people, even our lectures are more interesting by simple virtue of seeming more immediately relevant to our careers. One very interesting thing I've noticed: despite all the effort we make to be formal and follow protocols, there remains a wide margin of error in diagnosis and treatment. I know well which supervising doctors to ask for a treatment plan review if I don't want to do a restoration on a tooth, and which ones to approach if I do want to restore, even the smallest aberrations.  The old saying is very true: get two dentists to suggest diagnosis and treatment, and you'll get at least three opinions. 

End of D1 Update:
      It's more difficult than I thought it would be, or perhaps I'm worse at managing my time than I thought I was. Regardless, my original goals are largely unchanged. I'll also add that towards the end of the year we were given a presentation on lasers, those are techniques I'd like to learn. 

      Everyone thinks I want to be a dentist because of sculpture. I'm lucky to already have hand-skills, that's the reason I believed I could get through dental school. It has occurred to me, that another, huge reason I want to be a dentist is because  of how much I've always hated going to the dentist. People who are afraid of dentists (most people) will recognize my empathy, and take comfort. It's hubris, believing I can be a likable thing that nobody likes, nonetheless, I'm in good company. Speaking of, I had a not uncomplicated procedure performed by student doctors at NYUCD. It was as essential a part of the learning experience as any other thus far.

As I have just finished my undergraduate education in May, it is certainly a bit of a transition period from the casual lifestyle of a college student to a more professional atmosphere.

One of the snags I've run into in clinic is timing. I have found myself running passed the allotted time for appointments. I've found that it's usually because I wait for the faculty too long or dont use my time as efficiently as I should.

These past couple of weeks have been quite a learning experience. I've been doing a few new treatment plans, several with dental complexities. In addition, I have made a few axium mistakes and learned (the hard way) a few new coding policies (continuation of comprehensive exam should always be treatment planned along with the initial comprehensive exam, the right way to treatment plan SRP and perio maintenance, the fact that you can leave notes for individual teeth in the axium odontogram, and that SRP may be indicated even if the probing depths are not over 5 mm). Here are some of the interesting cases I am currently working with:

David Ortiz- 44 y/o male, previous drug abuser, almost edentulous maxilla (4 non restorable teeth with gross decay)
 I started this case with Dr. Lee for a maxillary CD and mandibular RPD, and will now be working with Dr. Jyoshi. We will be making a couple of changes to the RPD, and will no longer need to do survey crowns. The patient is anxious to get the process moving, but can only come on Monday evenings 6-8 PM and couldn't make it the past two weeks.

Luis Mejia- 68 y/o male, high blood pressure controlled with medication
We are considering the ethical dilemma of doing what the patient wants- extract teeth that ARE restorable in favor of a partial denture instead of doing what would be ideally indicated dentally- crowns on all remaining teeth.

Linda Ziering-
Treatment plan in progress. The patient will have an edentulous space on the posterior upper right after treatment so it is interested to think of ways to help the patient maintain quality of life. She has an EXTREMELY strong gag reflex and it was my first time trying to take impressions on a patient with that strong of a gag reflex + a very high palate. She even gagged while taking bitewing xrays. 

Ateeb Hussein- 20 y/o male with high risk for caries
This patient has already had previous extractions and is congenitally missing one premolar from each quadrant. He has several (8) caries into the dentin and spots of demineralization. I strongly emphasized OHI to him and told him that if he changes his dental care habits, he can profoundly save his dental health, especially considering he is so young. I need to prescribe prevident to him at his next appointment as well. He now seems really committed, but probably needs continued encouragement and reinforcement. 

Marlene Browne- high blood pressure, female
Patient has an edentulous space on her mandibular ridge in the area of #30. She would like to consider getting an implant. She also needs a crown on one of her teeth with existing composite but very involved recurrent decay. It should be an interesting case because it will probably be the first crown I work on.

This week, I also worked on an emergency case where a patient came in with a fractured 6 unit temporary dental bridge (#6-11). It was a difficult treatment because fabricated a new temporary bridge doesn't yield any guaruntee that the new one would not crack as well. There just seemed to be too much flexion in the area of the anterior teeth , so the remaining abutment teeth, since the luxatemp matierial is so thin in these areas, cracked regardless. We reinforced the luxatemp material with bonding agent and composite to give it a little more strength and decrease the brittle factor. 

I also went to treatment planning this morning (on accident, because my actual session is apparently not until 9/30). It was a very interesting case though, and I think it reinforces my fascination with periodontistry. It's amazing to me how everything in our field really does depend on the soft tissue and bone surrounding teeth.",D3F

Over the course of the past few months, I've learned that MANY things encompass what makes one develop into a professional. I find that the greatest learning comes from the little things.

In addition, being a dental professional depends heavily on timeliness and preparedness.

A week of learning how to understand patient's expectations of treatment at the school, and managing patient's expectations with what is actually possible. I've found gaps in my ability to present the treatment plan to my patients in a way that they can understand and follow. Two of my patients this week have shown confusion and misunderstanding in their own treatment, and I believe in has come from me not taking the time to explain procedures and reasons for their need in a language that is relatable to the patient. I need to be better prepared and knowledgeable of the services I am providing to more effectively answer my patient's questions and concerns.",D3F

It was a very rewarding experience to be able to see this case through from start to finish. Throughout the entire crown fabrication process things moved relatively smoothly, and no major complications were faced. One aspect that I was nervous about was the crown preparation and fabrication of the acrylic provisional. While I had made the provisional many times in SimLab, I was still nervous of the acrylic setting on the tooth and me not being able to remove it when I wanted. Also, I had only used a vacuum-form matrix to fabricate the provisional once previously, and it was what Dr. Comut had recommended I used. Thankfully the provisional came out well first try, which I wish I could say always happened  on 11th floor. The final delivery of the crown too a lot of reduction from the crown's palatal surface, so much so that the crown was nearly left without a cingulum. Upon cementing the crown and having the patient state her satisfaction, I felt very proud with how the case had turned out. Some pictures were taken and they'll serve as a reminder of the first of many crowns that I will deliver in my career.",D3F

I got the opportunity to communicate with lots of people and made me become competent in emphasizing with the patients.

Faculty and I agreed that not only would this patient not benefit from an immediate denture as he had no teeth that required immediate replacement, he would also need a classic upper denture long term so to make an immediate would really be doing the patient a disservice.

I want to be a professional who can prevent patients from encountering harm. I want to lead them away from restorations. In order to achieve this, I must be able to accurately diagnose and educate the patient. Currently, I lack the ability to see the big picture when I review patient's medical history and X-rays.",D3F

I have a general routine for each appointment and it is helping me to stay organized.

I want to return their trust by providing the best and honest service. The more I get to interact with patients, the more I realize how the last two years of studying in dental school were worth it.",D3F

I find that I'm faced with ethical dilemmas more often than I would have anticipated. I am trying to figure out the boundaries and not enter into a sticky grey area. 

It seems that most people are concerned with ""the best way to get CEE's"". I would rather do what's most appropriate for the patient and not let the fear of getting enough CEEs guide my decisions.",D3F

I am feeling fully immersed into the clinic at this point. Although I realize that there is still an immense amount of learning for me to do, I find myself really enjoying this time as my peers are coming together to help one another and support each other through this process. In addition, I find the faculty are aware of the fact that we are new and they take additional steps to ensure our full learning experience.",D3F

I have been managing my patient roster, learning the intricacies of dealing with a diverse group of faculty, front desk associates, and supply desk workers. It has been an interesting balancing act, but I am quickly learning that it is well within reach given the knowledge that I've learned here at school, and my previous work ethic.",D3F

I intend to dedicate myself to communities that lack access to oral care. I will continue to improve my education and stay current with the new information and literature that is presented to the dental community. I will work on my skills to make sure that my hand skills continue to improve over time.",D3F

Right now, I don't feel so comfortable on some of the procedures, but under the guidance of the faculties, I believe that will soon change. Currently, I am working on complete denture with a patient with Dr. Shackman, and just by watching him demonstrate the border mold itself allows me to learn so much.",D3F
