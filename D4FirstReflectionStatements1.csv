1,Q2a1zJef,Private Personal,06-11-16 18:08,18.13333333,"Sternberg's triangular theory of love states that with passion, commitment and intimacy consummate love is attainable. It is my belief that integrating these three components as my guiding values will ultimately lead to my idea of a consummate life: my triangular theory of success.  Indeed, it is my journey as a dental student that led me to what I believe is a consummate life.  As a dentist and as a woman, I yearn to continue my dental career within this triangular theory of success; satiating my passion for the dental discipline, committing myself to the healthcare profession, and building an intimate bond with my patients. Some believe that reaching perfection is unattainable, but there is something truly 'consummate' about dedicating yourself to something you love and developing the wisdom needed to treat patients with different needs and challenges.
	
My first year as a dental student was by far the most difficult, but it was also the most rewarding one given it was the validation of my love with the field. Midway through the semester I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and she became a reminder that I was not only going to school to fulfill my dreams, but also to fulfill hers. Thankfully there were no complications and I managed to maintain my pre-partum schedule and be a fulltime mom. Balancing being a student, wife and mother helped me to fully understand the power of my calling. I was backed by a loving and nurturing family that inspired me to dedicate myself to a career and that gave me the tools to be a versatile woman. I knew back then that I still had a long road ahead of me, but that nothing could stop me from reaching my goals.  

Along the academic road was entering clinic, an experience which marked me profoundly as an individual and as dental practitioner. Treating patients only cemented my desire to become a dentist, as it was through practice that I came to comprehend my devotion to working in the care of people. Your patients place all their trust in you and seeing that gave me the confidence I needed and served as a great motivator. Needless to say, I was immensely excited to take all my book wisdom and apply it to actual people. It was only until I began hands on work that I was able to apply my unique skills of dental artistry.  Once my patients began referring their friends and family members, I realized that not only did my patients have faith in me; they were witnesses to the high quality of my work. 

Four years have passed since I entered dental school, and on record this time shows the dedication I put into my education; however, this time was so much more than studying for me. In four years I transitioned into the woman I am today, learning how to juggle being a wife, mother, student and working woman. While my perseverance and determination were strong, there were moments when my inner struggles almost got the best of me. It wasn't easy putting all my focus on my career when there were people depending on me, and while there were plenty of sleepless nights and disappointments, I learned through this journey that nothing worth fighting for is easy. I came out knowing what I was capable of and that ultimately my resiliency would be the determinant of the outcomes in my life and my career. I am completely resolute on being a dental practitioner, on helping people, on accomplishing revolutionizing things within my field and looking back on my journey I realize that I have acquired the passion, commitment and intimacy within my concentration to say I have attained my idea of a consummate life",D4F
2,Q3KOrarY,Ethic Reflection,29-11-16 1:16,1.266666667,"As a health care professional, it is my duty to be ethical in all my actions and interactions. In treating patients, I will learn about the community around me so that I can be culturally sensitive and empathetic. I will also stick to a code of ethics that I will hold myself to. These will include putting my patient's desires, and health and oral health above my own personal desires. I will always provide my patients with all their options so that they may be able to make the best decision for their oral health based on their limitations and their understanding. I will always document my procedures and any important events that occur during my patient's visit, so that I can legally protect myself and themselves, and so that the work is documented for future review. I will  never discriminate and will serve all equally, regardless of ethnicity, gender, faith, sexual orientation, etc., taking into consideration the various cultures and beliefs of my patients and being sensitive and understanding of them.",D4F
3,Q3KOrarY,Private Personal,29-11-16 1:16,1.266666667,"As a dental student, I will strive to learn about various oral health diseases and their symptoms, as well as different methods to improve oral hygiene. I will also learn the processes behind these diseases, and how to treat them. In the clinic, I will learn about the characteristics of each teeth, how to restore them via crowns, fillings, or root canals, how to remove caries, how to make complete and partial dentures and how to create models and impressions for studying a patient's mouth or for preparing crowns or retainers. I will also learn how to interact with patients in terms of explaining procedures to them in words they can understand, in a manner that is respectful, and in a empathetic and ethical way (putting the patient's health and wants above my own personal desires). Finally, I hope to learn from my colleagues and practice communicating and working together with them, while helping them in return. I believe that an environment in which everyone is honest and working together as a team ends up benefitting both those working as well as the patients being treated.",D4F
4,Q3KOrarY,Private Self Reflection,29-11-16 1:16,1.266666667,"Personally, as a professional I hope that I can possibly specialize in an area such as orthodontics, pediatrics, periodontics, or endodontics. However I will not limit myself to these specialties and I will explore other areas of specialty. I will also be satisfied with being a general dentist as well. Ultimately though, it depends on what I find I enjoy the most. I would also like to open my own clinic or at least have a clinic with another associate, especially because of the ease of accessibility to another dentist's opinion. Finally, I will strive to treat all my patients with respect, and all my colleagues with gratification and respect. I will try to be patient with patients that can be difficult to communicate with or patients who may have different ideologies than myself. I will make sure I am aware of various cultural beliefs and be sensitive to those and at the same time, be mindful that we are made up of a multitude of identities.",D4F
5,Q3KOrarY,Public Self Reflection,29-11-16 1:16,1.266666667,"In becoming a health professional, I hope to provide my patients with the best care I can possibly give. That includes continuing my education by going to conventions and conferences to learn about the most up to date technologies for oral hygiene. I will also constantly challenge myself to better my work, by self-assessing myself often and checking on past work to see if anything should be redone. As a professional, I will strive for clear and concise communication with the patient and with my colleagues. I will also attempt to ensure that all my patients understand the importance of oral hygiene to overall health and the various ways they can take care of their teeth and health. Even if my patients have difficulty practicing this, I want to make sure I give them all the information and knowledge so that they can make their own autonomous decision about their dental health.",D4F
6,Q3KOrarY,Professional Progress,29-11-16 1:16,1.266666667,"In my third year, I've learned much more about how the oral cavity can reflect diseases in the body or how the oral cavity can be affected because of other changes occurring in the patient's body. I've learned how to work with another student as a dental assistant and vice versa, learning more about team effort. I've learned the steps and processes needed in creating a complete and a removable partial denture. I've learned how to prepare crowns and bridges as well as make temporary crowns and bridges. I've learned more about how to interact with patients and now that I am in clinic, I am starting to understand how to communicate with my patients in a way that shows professionalism and competence while still being a student at the school. In the clinic I've been able to practice the above on all my patients, as well as how to give local anesthesia to my patients in the form of nerve blocks and infiltrations, comprehensive exams and x-rays, prophylaxis, scaling and root planing and restorations. I still have yet to perform endodontics yet but I aim to soon.",D4F
7,Q3KOrarY,Public Personal,29-11-16 1:16,1.266666667,"As a dental student, I will strive to learn how to best serve my patients, the community around me, and various communities around the country and the world. Specifically, I will become knowledgeable on the causes and symptoms of dental diseases as well as full body diseases, especially those that can become evident in the oral cavity. I will learn to treat patients both in the short-term and long-term capacity. I will also strive to treat all my patients with respect, sympathy, and ethically, taking into account their various cultural identities and being sensitive and understanding of them. I will always put the patient's health and desires above any personal gain, and I will be sure to refer my patient's to other doctors or dentists if I do not feel able to complete a procedure. I will practice my communication skills and being honest with my patients. I will practice my own skills so that I am competent and able to serve others well. I strive to continue learning new methods, techniques, and technologies when appropriate, to be better able to treat my patients.",D4F

My integrity, personal standards, goals and aspirations are important factors in earning respect from peers, colleagues, patients, and the general public.

However, I would like to be exposed to a various different dental specialties not only through school curriculum but also through community outreach and volunteer service. As a dental student, I would like to graduate dental school in good standing with proficiency in general dentistry. As a health care professional, I would like to learn not only the technical skills but also the interpersonal skills to have fulfilling relationships with patients with various different background. I realize this skill would require me to uphold my ethical principles as well as the rules and regulation at all times. Moreover, I hope that I would be more open-minded and bold in making decisions.

However, this does not mean that one should be stagnant and passive in their profession. Rather, I believe it is important for professional to actively seek out for improvements and advancements.

I believe that as a healthcare professional, we have a duty to provide our patients with the most effective treatment and when we know we are not the right person for our patient to not hesitate and relay our patient to the right person. 

While in dental school I want to always put forth an honest effort in my work and not take any shortcuts because I want to make sure I really understand what is being taught as my future patients deserve that kind of honest effort from their dentist. Also I want to contribute to an honest learning environment and reach out to any peers that I may see struggling.

I feel like everyone is trying to meet the requirements and graduate and sometimes we may be tempted away from ethics but that is definitely a slippery slope that we should not go down. If the quality of our work and how we approach treatment deteriorates then what is the point of all this.",D4F
15,QRWhtutX,Private Personal,29-11-16 11:49,11.81666667,"I hope to work not just hard but smart and produce the results necessary to have multiple options ready when I graduate. Currently I am really interested in the field of pediatrics so I want to put myself in the position to learn as much as I can about the field and make sure when I do make a decision that it is an informed one.

While my passion in pediatrics grows from partaking in in-reach and out-reach events at NYUCD, I want to also explore other specialties so I can become a wholesome in my dental knowledge and ideals.

I am really happy this year that Citizen Schools has been fully integrated as one of the main outreach clubs at NYUCD. We also had our first dental screenings at GTP and many more scheduled to come. Also I am on track to pursue my passion in pediatrics.

Now that I am fully committed to becoming a pediatric dentist I hope to keep exploring the various areas of public health dentistry that I am hoping to have as integral part of my career.",D4F
16,QRWhtutX,Private Self Reflection,29-11-16 11:51,11.85,"Aside from the points mentioned in the public self reflection portion, I want to become more open minded and be better at taking criticism as that will be important when dealing with patients as well as my future dental team. So far into the year I have been good about being punctual but I want to persist in having good punctuality as it was a weakness of mine in the past.

I still feel I can be more organized. My work area still gets really messy after the treatment is done and sometimes I still forget all the supplies I need for that session. Out of all the clinical treatments we perform I still feel not as comfortable with endo and crown treatments. 

I think for a while I was losing sight of the patients I was seeing because I was being overwhelmed by my schedule but I am starting to learn to take a step back and really work on building that connection with all my patients new and old.",D4F
17,QRWhtutX,Public Self Reflection,29-11-16 11:50,11.83333333,"I believe in order to become a professional in the field of dentistry, you must go beyond knowing just the craft of dentistry. It also means how you present yourself and how you treat the people you are working with. For instance punctuality and respect are two important aspects that patients look for in a dentist aside from his/her technical abilities. A dentist that is unorganized or difficult to make appointments with is hard for the patient to trust in putting their oral health in. Also even though the dentist is the head of his/her practice, it takes a cohesive and supportive team of individuals to treat the dental patient properly. Thus, a dentist that does not present him/herself to the dental team in a professional manner will never gain their trust.

Not much has changed I still believe in what I wrote previously. 

One of the most important thing is to really listen to the patient's concerns. Don't approach a treatment session without an open mind, sometimes you need to adapt to the patient's needs.",D4F
18,QRWhtutX,Professional Progress,29-11-16 11:54,11.9,"At this point I am not entirely certain where I want to practice dentistry. I do know that if I feel that I am not ready once I graduate from dental school I will immediately look to do some residency to get myself to the level of competency I am comfortable to practice solo. I do want to eventually have my own dental practice and after some time try to expand.

At this point I am thinking of going into a career where I am practicing part time as a pediatric dentist but also explore the public health side of our profession. I think there is large room to grow especially for finding ways to target areas that are not having access to dental outreaches/screenings.

I hope to go into a pediatric dental residency prepare me to come out practice in community dental center or clinics that serve the disadvantaged. Later one I hope to use my experience to help the local community by implementing public health initiatives.",D4F
19,QRWhtutX,Public Personal,29-11-16 11:49,11.81666667,"I hope to become competent enough that when I graduate my friends, peers, and instructors will fully trust me to perform dentistry on them if need be. I hope to at least maintain the passion I had for this field when I walked to my first class this year and hopefully expand that passion when I graduate. I want to work  hard and to always be humble of the fact that I should never be satisfied with my level of competence in dentistry. As long as I keep learning I know I will be more competent than yesterday but not as competent as I can be tomorrow. 

As I am coming towards the end of my time here at NYUCD, a lot of my goals and aspirations are being met or still within reach. I  hope to pass on the things I learned from my faculties, peers, and wonderful patients to the third years so they can be awesome fourth years when it's their time.",D4F

I strive to live my life a certain way, and to treat others as I would want to be treated.  Since my time in clinic, I have noticed that some of my fellow dental students like to walk a fine ethical line, and they do things that I would not be ethically comfortable with.  But I try not to worry about these students, as I can only work on who I am as a person, and what kind of dentist I want to be.",D4F

Most of my patients want to give me the ""Dr"" title, but I really believe that I have not earned that distinction as of yet.  I usually just tell them to call me Mike/Michael.  I think that I will still be the same way once I have received the Dr. distinction.  I am not sure why that is though. Maybe it is due to my background and how I was brought up, but I just consider myself like everyone else with the only exception being that I would actually be a doctor.  Only when I am not around other dental students do I feel more like a dental professional.  My parents, brother and non-dental friends always ask me dental related questions, and I feel like I actually know what I am talking about with them, which makes me feel more and more like a dentist.",D4F

I finally get to apply the knowledge that i've gained in my first three years, as well as gain new knowledge and tips/tricks from the various faculty.  When I first started in clinic I was very nervous and unsure of how I would be able to deal with treating my patients.  Now that I have been in clinic for approximately a year and a half, I feel more comfortable and competent in my abilities.  To date I have completed almost all of my MDR requirements, and the remaining ones are currently in process and will be hopefully completed before winter break.  I also find that I am completing more complex procedures and becoming more comfortable in performing root canals, post/cores, crowns and complete and removable prostheses.  I also find that I am relying less and less on specialty faculties when assessing my patients' more complex needs and I only consult with them as a necessary step to confirm my findings/results.",D4F

I feel like I have learned a lot in my year and a half in clinic, and have improved in all aspects of dentistry.  While I understand the need for following the school's core curriculum, I am also intrigued about learning new techniques, procedures and materials outside of the dental school environment.   In terms of my progress through dental school, I feel more competent in properly diagnosing and treatment planning patients.   I find that my hand skills and performance when performing more complex procedures has significantly increased.  At times I find myself bored with simple procedures in clinic, and I wish there was a way I could be involved in working on more complex ones.  However, I feel and/or hope that once I begin a GPR program I will get to work on these procedures and expand my knowledge-base and continue to grow as a dentist.",D4F
26,UMXIJMd9,Ethic Reflection,13-12-16 16:39,16.65,"Having encountered many ethical situations, I think this relates directly to professionalism. Acting ethical means always doing what is right and just while keeping the patient's well-being at the center of attention. As we are told to act in a patient-centered focus we must always examine every situation with that idea at the forefront. Whether it be in didactics or in clinical I have been able to frame everything I've learned in the context of how will this affect my patient and it has helped tremendously in keeping me focused to acting in a professional and ethical manner.",D4F

I know that sounds kind of vague, and I haven't found a better way to express that just yet, but what I mean is to fix whatever facial deformities or defects that are present. My pre-dental society in undergrad would have dental health professionals speak every week and I remember one in particular where he should photos of people that had to wear facial prosthetics to cover what were essentially parts of their face or jaw missing. At the time I thought the very fact a prosthodontist could make something and give it to the patient to wear was amazing. But what I really want to do is go one step beyond that and make wearing the prosthetic unnecessary. Facial reconstruction is I think the coolest thing. From what I know I think leans heavily toward OMS and bigger hospital surgeries which I rather prefer than private practice. When we talk about improving quality of life, I believe there is no greater way to increase that than down this path.",D4F

The article talked about ""civic professionalism"" and how there is an inherent contract, or trust, between the public and the professional. And moreover, we as professionals should give back to the community for without the community providing patients how would we have learned our craft. I think that as I progress throughout dental school this will become more relevant and I know whatever opportunity I have to give back or do a community outreach I will try my best to make it happen.

To me,  a person's face is their most important feature giving them the self-confidence to go out and interact with the world.

You have people's trust and belief that you are there to help them and not take advantage of their situation. I will be a dentist that is respected and known for excellent work done under ethical criteria. I believe in the four principles of healthcare ethics: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. I strive to always be honest, straightforward and respect the rights of my patients.

Some of my future goals in dentistry include volunteering for programs that help underserved communities in the U.S and poverty-stricken areas throughout the world where dental care is not readily available. New York University College of Dentistry is in one of the best schools to facilitate my goals because it has many programs that serve the underserved communities. Furthermore, NYUCD has a diverse patient population, which allows me to interact with people of all different socioeconomic backgrounds.

I have noticed that some patients really try to pressure you into doing something that you may not want to do, or pressure you into making the procedure go faster, but it is important for us to take our time and follow all of the steps to avoid making any possible mistakes. At the end of the day, if we follow what we believe to be ethical, we should be able to sleep better at night.

Being a part of research at UCLA widened my horizon of knowledge and gave me real insight into the field of research. Also I believe I have become more empathic and compassionate towards my patients and able to interact very comfortably with people from different ethnicities and cultures which has instilled a sense of confidence in me.
In this last one year I have learnt a lot of aspects of dentistry, be it patient care, behavior management, understanding patient concerns, coming out with a reasonable diagnosis and carrying out the actual treatment for my patients.

Online assignment reflection: Being in a very intense 4 year dental program we constantly find ourselves multi-tasking. With clinical requirements and deadlines/ patients/ formatives/competencies/ didactic courses/applications/boards... etc it is very hard to ""shut off"" our multi-tasking and try focus on one thing. Yes, I agree the work suffers and I am physically and emotionally tired, but the countless deadlines make it nearly impossible to focus on one thing. The constant reminders of requirements, competencies, formatives on time prevents us from focusing on one thing alone. I agree with the podcast that we would be more efficient and less drained but does not seem possible in dental school. From today on I will try to focus on one thing rather than focus on multiple/ multitask and hope it will make me more efficient.",D4F

For example, what would you do in a situation in which you accidentally nick the patient's gums but they are under anesthesia and are unaware of this happening, or what do you do if the treatment plan the son prefers differs from the treatment plan his very elderly father would like for himself. It's a very interesting topic to discuss as there are almost always different opinions on how to handle the same situation, with many possible correct ways to tackle a possible problem. With the many clinic requirements that are expected out of us, it also presents a very real scenario of how to balance what is expected from us by the school and what is expected from us by our patients.

This is sometimes harder said than done, as no one wants to call up a patient to tell them they have to come in for yet another final impression, or that the lab work that was sent back is not fitting. Also, it's incredible how being prepared before appointments and patiently responding to patients to make sure they understand the treatments outlined have a huge impact in reducing any anxiety they may have experienced towards their appointment.

Many patients really rely on us to help them through whatever their dental situation may be and often, we are the only connection to them receiving the care they need.

I'm excited to add upon this knowledge in clinic and in subsequent courses to properly treatment plan and treat cases when addressing patient needs. Ultimately I hope to develop a strong relationship with my patients and staff, and build a sustaining practice.

This includes that every dentist has their own personal theory about what it means to be a professional, some which I agree with and others not so much. I still think the most radical changes in my progress occur when I interact with patients, especially those with more complicated cases.

The first year of dental school was plagued by many cheating issues within our class which test our moral grounds and how we live up to them. Often times, we would have upperclassmen share previous exams and study sheets and it was our decision to distribute them to create a level playing ground when it was exam day. During second year, we saw many of our classmates going to all distances to succeed on practicals and competencies, whether that meant bringing pre-prepared teeth or drilling outside the mouth. It was up to us whether we approach our classmates and challenge their moral standards. As a third year, the quest for CEE and MDR leads students to questionable ethical decisions and tests our ethical judgement since we must always remember to put our patient's needs first and foremost.",D4F

For the past few years, I have been shadowing in the pediatrics department to learn more regarding the special ways that a dentist must attend to pediatric patients.

34,QRWlOuPe,Ethic Reflection,15-09-16 7:05,7.083333333,"Ethics can become a challenge sometimes during patient treatment in the clinic. We all have requirements to meet and competencies to take and sometimes we may find ourselves drafting a more elaborate treatment plan than what the patient actually needs in order to benefit ourselves. However, as a health professional, I must keep in mind my patient's interests above my own. So far I have really kept to the ethical standards and have not done something for my patient that is against his or her own wishes. Ethics is communicating to the patient all the alternatives to a treatment plan and then let him or her decide what is going to be done.

Ethics is doing what's objectively right for the patient and trying to change the patient's own personal perspectives that may be detrimental to his or her own health. Being an ethical professional means doing what's morally and objectively right for the patient all the time despite conditions that can influence one's own personal opinions.

I had my first real struggle with ethics with a difficult patient. He was always very impatient and aggressive and I have to admit that in order to avoid him I wasn't as persistent in bringing him in for dental treatment. In one of his very last communications with me, he expressed his dissatisfaction with my work and how he was handled by his previous student dentists and he angrily told me that my number was blocked on his phone. It is unethical to not bring the patient back based on how he treated me because I'm still obligated to treat him as a dental health professional.",D4F
35,QRWlOuPe,Private Personal,15-09-16 6:52,6.866666667,"Now that I'm officially treating my own patients in clinic, I hope to integrate everything I've learned thus far in all my years at the dental school and present myself as a competent, knowledgeable, and ethical health practitioner.

Besides having the right skills to treat patients, I have discovered that effective communication and patient management skills can make my experience of treating patients much more enjoyable at the college. I have had some patients tell me that they're very motivated to come to their visits on time and ready for treatment so that they can get their partial dentures quicker. These are the same patients who are on their first visit, excited about being treated in an educational environment, where there are plenty of faculty around to check on the work of the students to ensure good quality work is being produced. However, when they hear that on average it can take minimally 3 months for a set of dentures to be completed, between the time the materials are being sent back and forth from the lab, they just tend to disappear on me. How I manage these patients is I always explain to them all the pros and cons of the procedures they need and to them I always sound very knowledgeable. I have always been able to communicate effectively in terms of why they need certain kinds of treatment and what they should expect next. Nonetheless, I still have the one or two few stubborn ones who will say yes to everything and then they would fail the next two appointments. So if the explaining doesn't work, then I just kind of put these patients aside and just ignore them completely until they reach out to me themselves to schedule an appointment. Even after making an appointment for them, I will still warn them that if they fail the appointment one more time, I will remove them permanently from my roster. When I first started clinic, I wouldn't have managed my patients this way. I treated everyone nicely and wouldn't retaliate even when certain patients failed to show up once or twice. However, eventually I became fed up of having these kinds of patients ruin my clinical experience and me not being able to get anything done. Now that I have become ""meaner"" so to say, I have finally whipped some of my patients into shape. I won't let the one or few bad apples ruin my clinical experience when I have other patients who stick up for me in front of the faculty for being a great doctor in every aspect. Regardless of whether or not a patient chooses to continue treatment at the school, I always get the comment from every new patient that I always make them feel welcome and that I always take the time to communicate with them so that they don't just feel like objects that are there for me to drill on.

From the time I got braces from the orthodontist as a teenager and after I saw how much they improved my smile and bite after they were removed, I knew I was interested in the field of dentistry where I can provide immediate positive results for my patients.

Being a successful health professional requires a fine balance between being nice and empathetic to the patients but at the same time not forgetting that I am the one with the knowledge of what's best for them.",D4F
36,QRWlOuPe,Private Self Reflection,15-09-16 6:57,6.95,"A professional means to act in an ethical and professional manner where I would place the patient's best interests above my own. It doesn't only mean to perform the technical aspects of my field in an efficient manner, but it also means communicating and behaving in a professional way.

A professional is one that is competent and knowledgeable in a specific subject area. A professional is also someone who treats everyone equally and puts aside one's own personal biases when performing the task.

As a health professional, not only will I be judged by my technical skills. I will be judged by how I treat my patients as a whole and how I communicate with them.",D4F
38,QRWlOuPe,Professional Progress,15-09-16 7:07,7.116666667,"The progress I have seen in myself over the past few years at the dental school is that I have improved in my communication skills. I never thought communication and interpersonal skills were as important during the first two years of didactic studies. Now, I have discovered that communication is very important in enabling patients to understand me and to understand and appreciate the services I am providing for them. I've learned to be more expressive of myself and not just assume people know what I'm thinking of all the time.

Now that I have been treating patients in the clinic for a few months now, I have professionally matured as an empathetic, caring health professional. I am usually not one who speaks very slowly to express my thoughts; however, in front of my patients, I always take the time now to explain dental concepts to them to make sure they know what's going on and that they're comfortable with me before I proceed with a given procedure. Even though I'm still in the process of improving my skills in the various dental procedures I have never been exposed to before, I am still able to retain a friendly rapport with my patients so that they trust me to treat them. Their confidence in me enables me to feel much more comfortable with what I'm doing.

Throughout the progression of this year in clinic, I have developed into a more mature and understanding health professional. From dealing with patients of all different backgrounds and personalities, I have acquired the interpersonal skills to improve my communication with them. Everything is a new learning experience.

Now that I'm finally in my senior year, I have found that I have made a lot of progress as a dental professional. There were certain procedures I was never comfortable with doing before but now with more practice and exposure to these particular procedures, I am more confident in doing them in a more timely efficient manner as well.",D4F

Now that I have officially transitioned into the clinic and have started treating my own patients, I find that I have grown and matured as a health practitioner. It used to be that I would just memorize information solely for the purposes of acing school exams. Now, it's all about applying the theoretical principles I have learned in class on a case by case basis in managing my patients. I strive now to become a well rounded clinician, one who can be held accountable for my own actions and one who does what's best for the patients all the time.

It has been almost a whole year that I have started to treat my own patients in clinic. There is no better satisfaction than being able to improve my patient's oral health and smile and being that clinician to make the special difference. Besides the technical aspects of dentistry, I find that patients pay more attention to how much I care about them and not how much I know. I'm glad to know that I'm not only a dental technician to my patients but also a friend who can lend an ear and actually listen to what they have to say as well.

Now that I'm a rising D4, I definitely have become more familiar with clinical procedures and am more confident in the work that I do. I have matured over this last year that I have been in clinic. I have acquired so much practical knowledge from my clinic faculty that I would not have gotten from textbooks alone.

Thus, in order to be the top of the class, you need to you have those past exams. Inevitably, students will find their way to get to those past exams and this was considered cheating.

I sometimes felt like I lacked the confidence in doing certain procedures, when I compared myself to others.

Within this past year, I have been able to gain more confidence in treating and managing patients, and have become very passionate about it.

Self assessment is a critical component in becoming a competent professional since it allows one to see where they were and how much they have progressed. It also allows one to realize that there is always more room to grow and it allows one to add on to the list of what they find the most valuable. It also provides as a reference and reminder of what they found to be valuable in the past.

The choices we face with patients and the best treatment that we can provide sometimes conflict with patient's ability to afford and the patient's perception of what is needed. I did not understand how the steps of treatment planning had an integral part of ethics within its infrastructure. I do understand much better now of why us, the practitioners, need a firm understanding of ethical guidelines to make our treatment planning decision. Because when everything else sways, this ethic principle is firm and steady, and it should acts as the light house in the midst of a storm when one is clouded with questionable practice at times. After more than a year in the clinic, I now always present the best treatment option to my patient disregard their financial ability.

There is a lot that can come in the way of treatment planning - but I plan to continue to provide best patient care no matter what. I have learned that if you think something is weird, there is no shame in approaching a colleague or faculty for help.

Based on what I see and hear, I worry about my requirements but vow to never allow myself to be unethical, even if in trouble with completing CEES. This is something that personally has really upset me at the school - but I know that I never want to compromise my ethics in treating patients in order to keep on track.

Working in this environment has taught me a very valuable lesson. I never want to work in an institution or practice that I feel compromises the behaviours of my colleagues or makes me feel the way I have come to feel at NYU.

Throughout my time in clinic I have also watched many faculty. I continue to seek advice and help from those who I respect and plan to learn as much as possible from them before I graduate. In my time thus far, I have also seen faculty who I disagree with and disrespect. I find it a challenge when they approach me to treatment plan with and I disagree with their plan and way of interacting with the patient. As a student, it is hard for me to go over their head and find another faculty to work with once they have approached me. That being said, I do my best to avoid this faculty at all costs and have noted certain behaviour and interactions with patients that I find inappropriate and mentally note never to act that way.

Meanwhile I had gained dental skills from GDS class and now I am able to perform preparation and restoration of caries teeth. Through classes such as health promotion, multidisciplinary, radiology, I learned what to do in the clinic, how to fill out chart, how to communicate patients as well.

I finally found what my passion serves and because of this I had the drive to push myself academically, present research and find valuable mentors within oral surgery. I may have taken a rode less traveled but in a way, that allows me to see oral surgery as more than just a job. I see it as a healing art. My story is not that of a typical OMFS applicant but because of this I offer resilience, creativity, a love for public health and a motivation that makes me a key team player who often takes the lead when needed.

Recently, I have learned that there are many unethical things that happen in the ""real world"" in private practices.  For example, I was speaking to a dentist that practices in California--she told me she had to leave a practice because they would do inlays/onlays only even if a 2-surface MO or DO posterior restoration was indicated.  I honestly could not believe it--and she told me that is pretty normal.

If patient insists, we also have the right to refuse providing care if we believe patients' decision is causing harm to oneself.

I believe this is an important factor when it comes to treatment planning in clinic.

By following these ethical principles, I will be a better clinician and will be able to serve my patients in the future. There are always difficult cases where different ethical principles come into conflict and learning how to ethically proceed is an important skill to have.

Being a professional involves possessing the correct knowledge to share with your patients in a respectful and effective manner. It is also important to dress professionally since patients can make many assumptions about a person from their appearance alone. By dressing and acting maturely, patients feel like they are in capable hands and will be open to listening to advice that is given. We should work to actively involve our patients in the treatment planning process, but we must make sure we do not let them dictate the treatment plan to us.

I understand everyone is subject to making mistakes in a lifetime, but at least in this professional field I feel like I should make no mistakes because it has direct consequences in the treatment outcome.

It has been a month seeing patients. From what I have experienced so far, it is always a good idea not to hasten to come up with a definitive diagnosis and treatment planning because you may easily neglect some findings, especially when you are doing head & neck exam. It takes time to carefully go through all that is required to do for each patient, but I realized that as you put more time and effort into the basic findings, the more you could find what is going on in patients' mouth correctly.

Now that I have basic knowledge about the sciences behind dentistry, I will utilize it to provide the best patient care and treatments.

62,UNeX45gI,Ethic Reflection,09-10-16 13:55,13.91666667,"I am disappointed that there have been problems with cheating on tests and exams within my class. I think there should be stricter punishments for being caught as I think cheating devalues the dental education when people are able to continue these habits and do not face consequences.

I am also concerned with how people treat patients. I recognize that the school puts pressures on us. In order to graduate on time we have MDR requirements and a certain number of CEEs to complete. We must make patients a priority. It's not ethically sounds to see a patient as CEEs before seeing the patient as a person first. This is especially true with the the year coming to an end and the stress of the completion of MDRs.

In addition, I think that nonmaleficence, one of the bioethical principles we are taught to abide has environmental considerations. I think as responsible health care profressionals we should also be educated on the impact of our work on the environment. Environmental health impacts our patient's health. The waste and materials used in dentistry should be more critically looked at to ensure we are not doing harm to our current and future patients.


I have had to make a difficult realization that as much as it is important to help people, you shouldn't stop going out of your way for your patients. However, you need to realize that you cannot help people who are not ready to help themselves. I have chosen this role of helping provide health and wellness to patients, it is only ethical to continue to give a patient every opportunity to change their health around.

It is an interesting transition when it comes to ethical considerations. In practice, no one will be behind you questioning your clinical decisions. We can only hope that through careful examination in clinic and great mentors that we will all be able to make good ethical decisions.",D4F
63,UNeX45gI,Private Personal,05-09-16 12:30,12.5,"Prior to my acceptance into NYU, I had hoped to get involved in the Survivors of Torture Program as a D4 elective. Since then, I have felt like I had more of an interest in faculty practice and oral medicine. I have been accepted into an Honors in Oral Medicine and have spent the last few weeks becoming accustomed to the program. I have an interest in oral medicine as I have gained a lot of respect for the faculty that run the elective. The faculty have been great professors in OMPR and General Pathology. I also have a history of cancer in my family and feel like I would be good at empathizing with patients who have a suspicious lesion and have come in for a biopsy.
 I have looked into pediatrics as I completed 6 month clinic observation at Bellevue. Pediatrics may be something I consider after I have practiced general dentistry for a few years. Due to financial constraints and anxiousness to get out of school and get into practice, I will put this off and reevaluate in a few years whether it is something I would like to commit to.

I have learned that I need to become more independent in clinic. It is important as I am approaching my 4th year that I transition to being able to make my own decisions in terms of patient care and then finalize these plans with the faculty. Next year, I will be practicing next year under my own license.

I have made contact with Leon, a student who graduated from NYU two years ago. He is sharing his experience with hawaii and working in a dental office. There is a lot to consider. The average age of people living around you. Opportunites for learning courses. Availability of other doctors to learn and grow with. How you are financially compensated.",D4F
64,UNeX45gI,Private Self Reflection,09-10-16 13:52,13.86666667,"I find the greatest challenge for me in attempting to be a professional is my nervousness and cautious nature when it comes to treating patients. I am not at my best if I don't feel confident and it is really challenging to feel confident when you're trying to complete a task you have only done once or twice before. I don't think nervousness and professionalism go hand in hand. A patient needs to feel that they can trust in their doctor and if they aren't confident in themselves how can a patient be confident and comfortable with the doctor? I have overcome this challenge with really developing strong relationships with my patients. I think my patients understand that I am very knowledgeable and that I am cautious as I do not want to make a mistake (and this stems from my interest in offering them the best possible care). I would much prefer if I could be confident in myself and be able to stay calm during a procedure but that will come with time and experience. I am confident that my nervousness will be reduced with time as it has already reduced in the passing months.

One of my more recent challenges when it comes to being nervous during treatment was completing a pulpotomy. The patient had very dense bone and the tooth was very hypersensitive due to inflammation. The patient was very sensitive as I approached the pulp but I knew that I had to reach the pulp and administer a intrapulpal injection as quickly as possible. The patient was moving his head every time I attempted to gain access. I was nervous he would hurt himself or myself. I overcame this challenge by thinking I that I wanted to minimize pain overall- some short term pain for long term relief.


I anticipate that I will be reviewing notes and podcasts often in the first few years of practice. It is one thing to learn knowledge prior to first hand experience and accessing information at the time of having a patient with a need in front of you. A professional keeps up with current knowledge, recognizes weakness and acts to strengthen each of my weaknesses.",D4F
65,UNeX45gI,Public Self Reflection,27-09-16 11:29,11.48333333,"I intend to conduct myself in an ethical and moral manner inside and outside of the dental profession. I intend to show up early, be prepared and always do a through job.

The definition of a professional is simple to state but challenging to follow through on with every single patient in every single circumstance. Some days are harder than others- you're frustrated, you have challenges outside of the clinic that are on your mind. I think a professional is someone who tries their best to uphold a standard but recognizes his/her short comings. A professional knows when to step away from a situation and breathe and manage a situation to the best of their ability while recognizing the challenges. Working with the public can be challenging, people get frustrated, treatments can be difficult and though you may feel like stepping away, you need to continue and push through.

I am beginning to appreciate how there are multiple 'right ways' of doing things- this brings me some peace that if you are following evidence based research and fulfilling patient goals, you are practicing responsibly.

 I feel as though I am now more naturally taking on the role of a professional. It s not something that I need to try at anymore, with experience I have become more empathetic, patient, understanding yet firm in my recommendations to patients.",D4F
66,UNeX45gI,Professional Progress,05-09-16 12:32,12.53333333,"I am excited about an honors in Oral Medicine. I feel that I am very patient centered- I really care for their overall well-being and I think this is a very important quality when treating people with suspicious lesions or pathology. 

I  thought that after being in clinic for the past several months would allow me to be less nervous around my patients. I have made improvements but I am still a nervous and cautious person by nature. I am confident that with time it will lessen. I have already seen improvements. One week I can't figure out how exactly to remove a temporary crown, I am struggling with the removal of the cement etc but then just that next week I had a patient requiring the same treatment and after having experienced this once before, working with the temporary came very easily. It was after I gained confidence through experience did I feel prepared to see this second patient.

The more I think about it, I think that the reason that I am finding clinic challenging is that I am really trying my best to do it all. Becoming a dentist shouldn't be easy, you're working with people with strong personalities and opinions, there are barriers to care such as finances and insurance terminations, medical consults that put care on pause. It is not as simple as just doing the treatments that patients need. I am trying to give each patient the best possible care but it really can be a challenge sometimes, it is more than likely that there will be an unforseen roadblock. My next steps will be to anticipate roadblocks before they happen.

I was extremely challenged in my first oral surgery rotation. I felt that my previous encounter with my wisdom tooth extraction that left me traumatized. I had to overcome a lot to be able to extract a tooth. After a week of observing and learning I was finally able to extract a tooth on the last day and it was a great growing experience for myself.

I have been given the opportunity to explore sustainable dentistry. I have held a class council role and two student council greening representative positions.  I spoke at several conferences on the topic ASDA conference, EUEC conference, NYUCD Research days, Sigma Xi Conference.  

I completed a clinic observation February-June 2015 at Bellevue in the pediatric dental clinic as I was looking into a pediatrics specialization. I think I will spend a few years as a general dentist after graduation but will keep pediatrics as an option for the future if I am feeling unfulfilled as a 'kid friendly' general dentist. 

I am a secretary in the interdisciplinary education group- I am learning how important interdisciplinary work really is in detecting errors and finding a holistic care for the patient. I am continuing with this role into my 4th year.

While one treatment option was considered ""ideal"" for the patient, a faculty asked me if the patient would be a good candidate to take care of the treatment. If they were not fastidious with their oral hygiene, the ideal treatment was no longer ideal. The patient told me they would go with the treatment option I recommended, because they trusted me. I had the dilemma of choosing the 'ideal' treatment option that would be more aesthetic, longer lasting, and a great case for me to learn how to do a certain procedure, or choosing the less than ideal treatment that would have a better prognosis considering the patient does not have a good history of oral hygiene.

Dental schools only give foundational knowledge to students, the students have to be a proactive, and life long students in order to stay relevant in the ever changing dental field. My goal for the remainder of the D3 school year is to be a better communicator towards my peers. There are many times that I'm not as approachable as I'd like towards my peers and colleagues, because I felt tired and stressed. It's is my top focus for the remainder of the academic that I collaborate more with my colleagues while I'm in clinic. The third year has been a challenging year for me.

It takes a lot of self-awareness and discipline to behave in a manner that is consistent with NYUCD's policies, as well as satisfying patients' expectations. There were times when I acted in ways that I thought were slightly off setting from NYUCD's policies. I felt regret for my mistakes. Yet, at the same time these mistakes were chances that helped me improve myself. I guess becoming a professional is something that takes time and a lot of hard work. I am constantly trying to be a better healthcare professional. With the help of my faculty and peers I will be a well trained dentists who takes care of patients to the best of my abilities. I realize that there were times when I feel like some people in the group practice have behaved unprofessionally.

Behaving professionally in the clinic setting all the time is challenging. Sometimes I've seen people talk a bit too loud, or make an inappropriate comment, and I've certainly caught myself a few times where I talked a little bit too loud, or was late to an appointment. I certainly didn't feel too good. There's always room for improvement. The biggest part of becoming a professional is to always striving to learn from one's mistakes, and focus on self-improvement. So when clinic starts again I will make sure that I focus on correcting my mistakes, and become a better healthcare professional.

Becoming a professional takes a lot of hard work, and conscientious efforts. I've made mistakes while in clinic that did not reflect too well on my professionalism.

I will strive my best to work hard, and learn as much as I can so when I graduate I will be a well-rounded student and a more complete dental professional. 

There were a couple of times when I was late, or keeping my frustration under control seemed like very difficult.

As a student-dentist who is working to becoming a dental professional, I'd have to say that the road getting to the goal of being an efficient, self-aware, knowledgeable dental professional is hard. It's definitely doable, because many dentists (faculty, doctors whom I've shadowed) are the epitome of these standards. As for myself, I can only focus on the immediate future and strive to behave in ways that would make me a decent professional. I've certainly made progress if I compare the Landon 6 months ago versus the Landon at this moment, but like I said there's a long way to go. It's been a couple of months since I've been in clinic, and I absolutely loved it. There were moments when I was tired. These moments had helped me appreciate the notion of being a compassionate dentist even more. I always tried to work hard, be aware that my actions are measured and gauged by patients, who may not understand how I feel at times. I always push my tiredness aside and focus on providing the best patient care that I can achieve. Patients would thank me for being 'compassionate' towards them. Their gratitude made me realize that being a professional takes hard work and discipline. Being focused all the time on my patients is a hard thing to do. I appreciate my faculty, whom always seem to be focused all the time.
I think I have made tremendous professional progress since I've started clinic last year, and definitely I've made more progress compared to myself as a first year dental student. I can communicate well with my patients, build rapport while eliciting health information.

There are so much to learn from the faculty and my colleagues, yet there are so little time. It is my sincere goal that by the time I graduate from NYUCD I will have grown into a wiser, compassionate, a more prepare dentists who can meet any challenges that come my way in private practice. With the help of my colleagues, friends, family, and most importantly Dr. Resnick, I am confident that these two coming years will be the most productive years in dental school.

I owe it to them and to my profession to adapt by investing into work ethics. 
I wish I could say things slow down, that we regain our ability to learn in a humble manner. But instead we only seem to adapt to this brutal pace, pushing on to the finish line of graduation.

I didn't get a chance to write anything for the past few weeks, so I will try to sum it up.

July and August:

I started getting used to the way the clinic works and how axium works. I saw/felt what caries is. I learned (and am still learning) how to correctly identify caries based on the ICDAS system.
I learned that a restoration needs to be redone if the explorer 'sticks' by the margins of the restoration. I also learned that, based on color, you can have a 'leaky' restoration even if the margins seem to be in-tact (I'm still not so clear on this). But if the margins have a tight seal and the radiograph shows a radiolucency under the restoration, we need to think about what this might be other than caries.
I also learned how to cut off a crown when it becomes locked on a tooth (Dr. Moghadam was kind enough to sit and do it with me).

Week of 8/31

I learned that grinding/clenching can be a cause of widened PDL and not automatically an endo problem.

Week of 9/7

In oral surgery rotation and learned how to use extraction tools and how to properly extract a tooth.

Week of 9/14

I need to brush up on the differences and indications for when to use a prefab crown and when to use a cast post-core crown.

Week of 9/21

I learned the indications for PAs in 1A rotations
I learned how to properly do RCT
I made the mistake of not paying attention to detail before a tx, during a tx, and after a tx
I learned how to do proper tests/diagnosis when a patient presents to the clinic in pain

Week of 9/28
I learned the proper indications for diagnosis of emergency tx when a patient is in pain.

Week of 10/05
My patient this week came in with very deep caries. The caries was very black and I want to know why that happened. It ended up needing a root canal and I didn't really see why. Endo and general faculty said that the decay was circumferential around the canal, so I guess I just need to see more caries to understand.

Over the next 2 days I had no patients or cancellations so I helped out a lot in the clinic. I realized that I was able to think on my feet much better when it's not my patient. I keep getting flustered when I present a case to faculty...I need to work on that. I also realized that I have a much better understanding of prefabs and cast posts and when they are indicated.

I had a patient at the end of the week that I Tx planned with Dr. Soeprono. I realized that I feel very lost when I'm checking for caries and open margins on restorations and crowns. Unless it's blatant, my caries and open margin diagnosis is usually incorrect. I guess this is normal, but it's not reassuring. Thankfully Dr. Soeprono is very understanding when it comes to this situation.

Week of 10/12
My first patient of the week is my most complicated case and it's been overwhelming. I work very slowly when I'm treating him and it's hard to break that bad rhythm. I'm trying to be more prepared before I see the patient, but I feel like it's not working. Whenever a situation arises that's slightly different from the standard, I shut down and run to faculty. I feel like if I try to deal with the situation on my own then I might do something wrong or that I'm making a bad judgment call. I've been working with Dr. Moghadam she told me that she believes I know more than I think and that I should take more initiative and have more confidence when encountering slightly new situations (a situation I should be able to handle).

I had another patient that came in as an emergency and I should have known what to do to diagnose and treat the chief concern. I need to relax and keep a clear head when diagnosing.

Another patient this week was a little concerned because the prophy didn't take as long as usual. I found that amusing because I thought that it took me longer than usual because of the amount of calculus/plaque.

Week of 10/19

I didn't have many patients this week, so I spent my time observing other procedures and asking D4s misc question regarding fixed and removable pros.

I had a Class II restoration this week and I spent too much time trying to be conservative. The restoration was deep and I was very worried that I was going to hit the pulp. The restoration went well in the end.

Week of 10/26

I had to cut off a crown and redo a crown prep for a survey crown. Cutting off the crown was easier than I thought, but prepping the tooth was not. I also had trouble making a temp and faculty had to jump in and do it for me so I could end on time. I don't like when the faculty has to do this because it shows that I am not prepared enough. I know what I did wrong and hopefully I've moved passed those mistakes.

I had a restoration today that was deep and the patient was having pain once I reached the caries. Faculty tried to help get the patient anesthetized, but it didn't work. I'm curious as to why this happened as well as how to properly anesthetize the patient in this situation

I also had a few comprehensive exams to do this week and I'm not too happy about them. Diagnosing caries is very frustrating for me. Before I leave, I want to know how to diagnose caries based on ICDAS, but faculty seem to be split on this. I hear from the majority of faculty that the only way to clinically diagnose caries (unless there's gross cavitation) is by seeing if an explorer sticks. There are only a few faculty that go according to ICDAS and unfortunately it's frustrating.

Week of 11/2

This was an uneventful week since I didn't have many patients. I had a patient with the most calculus I had ever come across yet. I found that using the hand scalers was actually more effective in cleaning the supragingival calculus. It was more efficient and less painful for the patient (she is very sensitive to begin with).

I had a patient that needed a restoration done, but he came late so I only took impressions to make an occlusal guard (I'm realizing lately that I should take impressions of every patient I have at the first visit, this makes things easier down the line for subsequent treatments).

My patient came this week to have one of his teeth evaluated for RCT. The patient refused the treatment and much rather wanted to have it extracted instead. We went through the risks and benefits of both options and he decided on extraction. Dr. Soeprono made it very clear that everything must be well documented in the note (I can see this as being a good habit to develop so it doesn't come back to bite you in private practice).

Week of 11/9

I started a treatment of complete upper and lower dentures for a patient this week. On the one hand I have a good grasp on what needs to be done, but on the other hand I kind of feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. Border molding seems like a mystery to me of how it's done properly because we've never had real muscles and tissue to actually work with yet. I keep making it a point to ask Dr. Comut what he's looking for whenever I show him an impression, custom tray, border molding, etc. so I can understand what to look for myself even if I did it right by accident.

Week of 11/16

I had a patient this week that has a mouth full of caries and broken teeth. I felt very overwhelmed when I was doing the tx pl. I ended up speaking with Dr. Watson the next day when she was free to see where to go in the tx pl and I felt like I had a clearer picture of what to do and what to look for. I see that I need to understand when a tooth needs to be extracted and when a tooth should be saved (I can see that this depends on many factors, but I need a good system for determining this).

Also, I had a patient that presented with pain a few weeks ago and we diagnosed it as reversible pulpitis. We put IRM and it was less painful. We now took out the IRM and endo took a look to see if there are any fractures (which I learned can present as a dark line because bacteria might be stuck in the fracture). No fracture, but endo said to pack the composite slowly and incrementally so that there are no voids (some people are apparently more sensitive when it comes to having a filling and there being tiny voids).

I continued border molding this week. I suck. But I feel like I'm slowly getting the hang of it.


Week of  11/23

A patient came in this week complaining of pain. I really suck at treating emergency patients. I need to have the routine down of what to look for and what to ask. On the bright side, she was medically complex and I knew how to properly go about her tx and med consult.

Another patient came in this week with a totally bombed out third molar. I still don't have a handle on how we look at third molars. I thought the tooth could be saved, but the faculty immediately said it should be extracted because it's very bombed out AND it's a third molar.

I also continued border molding this week. I first had to adjust the custom tray properly. Dr. Comut showed me how to do this and it was super helpful. I really understood what he was trying to do and I feel like this really helped me. I hope I can reproduce this in other patients.

Week of 11/30

I had a patient this week that has severe periodontitis. He had a lot of crown and bridge work done and faculty said that he really just needs a full mouth SRP. I see why this was the case because his teeth were not mobile and it seemed better to leave everything along than to do a bunch of extractions. The patient also didn't want to have any teeth extracted. I asked perio about this later and I now understand that if a tooth has furcation involvement or severe bone loss/mobility, the patient is subject to developing an infection/abcess/cellulitis due to the bacteria trapped inside.
I started the SRP this week and it went pretty well.

Week of 12/07

I saw a sinus tract this week and it didn't look like I though it would. The pictures were were shown in class was just of a hole, but in the clinic it looked like a papule and you have to poke through it to trace the tract.


I had a patient come in for tx planning, but it was a disaster. I was bounced around from perio to pros and getting different opinions. I presented the case to Dr. Soeprono and that did not go well either. Dr. Soeprono was nice enough to walk me through the case and explain to me why Perio came up with the diagnosis that they did. I need to have a more though out opinion of what the tx pl should be before I come to faculty so I can learn something if I'm wrong.

I did a restoration this week that started as a class V but turned into a restoration that wen from facial to lingual. Interestingly we decided to not break contact and do the restoration from underneath. It took me a really long time and my back and butt were hurting, but Dr. Polokoff said I did a really good job and it was a hard restoration for anyone to do. He said I'll be one of the good D4s. That was nice.

Also, delivering an occlusal guard was easier than I thought.

Week of 12/14

I had a bunch of cancellations this week, but the main thing was border molding. I'm so slow and it's taking forever. The patient is also complaining of pain a lot, even when pros works with her. I'm learning new tricks here and there, but overall I think I just need to be more aggressive and confident in what I'm looking for.

Week of 1/4

My most complex patient is getting harder to handle. His mouth is just falling apart. His temp keeps coming off and now one of his crowns that he had done a year ago just broke off. I'm emailing back and forth between Dr. Soeprono and Dr. Moghadam to see what to do. It's kind of stressful, but I'm also learning a lot from the case...especially the fact that I must be faster in doing treatment.

Week of 1/11

I was in perio clinic all week. I got to see how to place bone grafts and implants. I also saw immediate implant placements. It was not what I thought it would be. I though it would be more guided, but it just seems like they have an idea of what angle to place the implant and they drill the hole.

Week of 1/18

I finally made the new treatment plan for my most complex patient. I sent work up to the lab, but it got sent back for overlooked details. I even had to go up to the lab with Dr. Moghadam last Friday to straighten something out. I'm trying my hardest to get this treatment done as quickly as possible.

Week of 1/25

I had a paient this week with an enormous BP reading and it showed me how important it is for a dentist to actually record vitals. After that experience, a few patients mentioned to me that they discovered they had high BP from coming to NYU for a dental checkup. I'd like to take this lesson with me throughout my career.

I did a class II on friday and it was a redo of an old restoration. The prep and restoration went really well and I was happy with it, but it took me way too long. I haven't done that many class IIs, but I need to be cognizant of the fact that I need to be more efficient. I'm way to conservative when I know I shouldn't be (even though I think being conservative is a good trait in its proper setting).

I had some cancellations this week, so I spent some of my free time speaking with Dr. Mohajer to get a better understanding of when we diagnose a tooth as hopeless. This was extremely helpful and I feel like I'm more aware of factors at play that would compromise the health of a tooth.

Week of 2/1

I had a few prophys this week. Those were fine.

I also had a periodic exam to do and I feel like I'm getting more comprehensive with my exams as well as getting faster.

I placed a post this week and I felt very prepared beforehand. However, doing the procedure was very different than preparing for it. Like my class II last week, I was hesitant to work as quickly as I could because of being afraid to perforate the root while taking out the GP. I had a little help from faculty, but overall I feel much more confident now that I went through the procedure.

I had to tx pl with Dr. Soeprono with a patient that had several phases in his tx pl. I saw that I was confused as to how to phase/sequence certain treatments, but Dr. Soeprono walked me through it and I now have a better understanding of phasing while tx planning and why it's so important. I want to be more cognizant of how to phase procedures from now on. Specifically, I was surprised to see that an extraction can be phased as pros (4) and not just disease control (2) based on the comprehensive tx pl. So this will ultimately have an effect on the order of treatments done. I was also pretty happy that I was able to walk through the treatment with my patient, explain it well, and have him see why the treatment plan was ideal for his oral health.",D4F

      It felt great to pass the boards, hard to say if that celebration is cooled a bit knowing everyone passed, makes it seem less special somehow, even so, it was a very difficult exam. I'm far more enthusiastic about the 2nd two years of dental school than I was about the first. Aside from the thrill of being in clinic and treating people, even our lectures are more interesting by simple virtue of seeming more immediately relevant to our careers. One very interesting thing I've noticed: despite all the effort we make to be formal and follow protocols, there remains a wide margin of error in diagnosis and treatment. I know well which supervising doctors to ask for a treatment plan review if I don't want to do a restoration on a tooth, and which ones to approach if I do want to restore, even the smallest aberrations.  The old saying is very true: get two dentists to suggest diagnosis and treatment, and you'll get at least three opinions. 

End of D1 Update:
      It's more difficult than I thought it would be, or perhaps I'm worse at managing my time than I thought I was. Regardless, my original goals are largely unchanged. I'll also add that towards the end of the year we were given a presentation on lasers, those are techniques I'd like to learn. 

      Everyone thinks I want to be a dentist because of sculpture. I'm lucky to already have hand-skills, that's the reason I believed I could get through dental school. It has occurred to me, that another, huge reason I want to be a dentist is because  of how much I've always hated going to the dentist. People who are afraid of dentists (most people) will recognize my empathy, and take comfort. It's hubris, believing I can be a likable thing that nobody likes, nonetheless, I'm in good company.

It is about carrying yourself in a certain manner and knowing how to communicate with others. It is about approaching every task with the right preparation and knowing how to manage time properly. As I have just finished my undergraduate education in May, it is certainly a bit of a transition period from the casual lifestyle of a college student to a more professional atmosphere. Even though I am younger than most of my peers, I certainly believe I am mature enough to make the right adjustments and become a true professional.

After looking at my public self reflection two years later, everything I wrote about core professional values still holds true, perhaps even moreso now that I am in clinic. Preparation is everything, and it has been very important for me to go to clinic everyday with an idea of what I hope to accomplish and a plan on how I will accomplish it. It is also just as important to be able to communicate with patients efficiently and in a way where they feel comfortable with everything you are doing. This part has come most easily to me throughout clinic, and I have learned a lot about from Dr. Soeprono and all the faculty on how to communicate with patients and come prepared to clinic everyday",D4F

Tomorrow I am delivering my first denture and am excited to see how it fits and feels for the patient.

In the process, I have become a better problem solver and my clinical skills have improved as well.",D4F

As of now, I know that I would like to make public health dentistry a priority for at least a few years after I graduate. In order to do this, I should develop my professional confidence and competency as well as learn to be a leader among my coworkers.

These past couple of weeks have been quite a learning experience. I've been doing a few new treatment plans, several with dental complexities. In addition, I have made a few axium mistakes and learned (the hard way) a few new coding policies (continuation of comprehensive exam should always be treatment planned along with the initial comprehensive exam, the right way to treatment plan SRP and perio maintenance, the fact that you can leave notes for individual teeth in the axium odontogram, and that SRP may be indicated even if the probing depths are not over 5 mm). Here are some of the interesting cases I am currently working with:

David Ortiz- 44 y/o male, previous drug abuser, almost edentulous maxilla (4 non restorable teeth with gross decay)
 I started this case with Dr. Lee for a maxillary CD and mandibular RPD, and will now be working with Dr. Jyoshi. We will be making a couple of changes to the RPD, and will no longer need to do survey crowns. The patient is anxious to get the process moving, but can only come on Monday evenings 6-8 PM and couldn't make it the past two weeks.

Luis Mejia- 68 y/o male, high blood pressure controlled with medication
We are considering the ethical dilemma of doing what the patient wants- extract teeth that ARE restorable in favor of a partial denture instead of doing what would be ideally indicated dentally- crowns on all remaining teeth.

Linda Ziering-
Treatment plan in progress. The patient will have an edentulous space on the posterior upper right after treatment so it is interested to think of ways to help the patient maintain quality of life. She has an EXTREMELY strong gag reflex and it was my first time trying to take impressions on a patient with that strong of a gag reflex + a very high palate. She even gagged while taking bitewing xrays. 

Ateeb Hussein- 20 y/o male with high risk for caries
This patient has already had previous extractions and is congenitally missing one premolar from each quadrant. He has several (8) caries into the dentin and spots of demineralization. I strongly emphasized OHI to him and told him that if he changes his dental care habits, he can profoundly save his dental health, especially considering he is so young. I need to prescribe prevident to him at his next appointment as well. He now seems really committed, but probably needs continued encouragement and reinforcement. 

Marlene Browne- high blood pressure, female
Patient has an edentulous space on her mandibular ridge in the area of #30. She would like to consider getting an implant. She also needs a crown on one of her teeth with existing composite but very involved recurrent decay. It should be an interesting case because it will probably be the first crown I work on.

This week, I also worked on an emergency case where a patient came in with a fractured 6 unit temporary dental bridge (#6-11). It was a difficult treatment because fabricated a new temporary bridge doesn't yield any guaruntee that the new one would not crack as well. There just seemed to be too much flexion in the area of the anterior teeth , so the remaining abutment teeth, since the luxatemp matierial is so thin in these areas, cracked regardless. We reinforced the luxatemp material with bonding agent and composite to give it a little more strength and decrease the brittle factor. 

I also went to treatment planning this morning (on accident, because my actual session is apparently not until 9/30). It was a very interesting case though, and I think it reinforces my fascination with periodontistry. It's amazing to me how everything in our field really does depend on the soft tissue and bone surrounding teeth.

9.30.15
This past week has been a whirlwind. Two of my patients referred their friends to me, both who require extensive treatment plans. It was a little stressful because there were several issues with the xray machines almost everyday this week. I will be continuing the treatment planning tomorrow and next week, when hopefully the x ray units are functional again. 

I also experienced my first unpleasant patient interaction over the phone, as I was trying to schedule an appointment with a patient who had been transferred to me by the front desk. Even before meeting me, he requested to see a different student dentist because he preferred a competent male. Although this was a little disheartening at first, I don't take it personally anymore because this was something the patient believed regardless of anything I could do. 

This past week, I also completed 3 restorations and selective SRP on patients. Fortunately, everything went smoothly with all of these procedures. I am also reading up on crown and RPD procedures again, as I will be beginning these procedures in the upcoming weeks. It seems like there was a lot we didn't learn in pre-clinical courses because there are so many dental materials and techniques to be aware of.

10.7.15

Things I am learning about myself:
1) Multitasking is just NOT my forte. I feel like a deer in headlights anytime I have to, because I really need to focus on one thing at a time to do anything effectively. I'm going to try to keep this in mind when I'm preparing for clinic as well.
2) I think I'm really good at the ""assistant"" role, in most circumstances. I've worked a variety of jobs for the past 8 years, since I was 16, and they have all been assistant-type roles. I think this helped me in my work ethic, being able to better deal with different people and personalities, and be able to work in new settings. However, I think it has become part of my nature now, as I am more comfortable being a sidekick, or assistant, or a supporter than to have to be a leader or in the spotlight. I think it might be time to step outside of my comfort zone and try to be more of a leader, because I will need to at least appear as one to be taken 100% seriously.

11.22.15

Every Thursday without skipping a beat, Dr. Polikoff asks ""why are you always so happy?"" in disbelief as he walks past my cubicle. And like a reflex, I always respond ""I'm living the dream"". Honestly, it really is true. This is the dream, every bit of it, from getting [almost] barfed on taking alginate impressions to later getting reprosil stuck throughout a patient's mustache. I'm thankful for the laughs, the craziness, the patients, and most of all, the unity that we have as a clinic that lets us share our triumphs and frustrations with each other. 

In the spirit of Thanksgiving, my absolute favorite holiday, I thought I would write a little about an article I read recently in the NY times. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/choose-to-be-grateful-it-will-make-you-happier.html?_r=1

It describes how you can actually become happier by forcing yourself to think of all the things you are thankful for. For a few years now as part of my morning routine, I make my cup of coffee and think of all of my blessings in life. It helps me carry a lot of positive energy with me throughout my day. It really helps me get through the times where I make mistakes, deal with tough situations, and witness negativity that is outside my control. Of all the things on Earth that we have little control over, I think it is nice to take charge of the things that are within our reach such as our attitudes, punctuality, and spreading good vibes. I hear from a lot of professionals that I'm still in the beginning and that I will inevitably become more jaded with time. I'm not sure about that, but I hope to hold on to my gratitude for as long as I possibly can.

SORRY!! Yes, it has been FIVE weeks since I have updated this beast. Despite this, I think the past 5 weeks have been the most stagnant in terms of the learning curve in clinic. The last few weeks of December, I switched my focus from living and breathing clinic, to trying to pass finals. I also began my pediatric rotation on Thursdays, and it helped me realize that I think pediatric dentistry is absolutely not for me (at least for now). I love working with kids in a variety of settings, but dentistry is just not one of them. It was heartbreaking to see how tormented several of the children were to be in a dental office. I even spoke with some of the faculty who are recent graduates, and their surprisingly bleak view of their day to day professional life did not do much to change my perspective. I think this completes me looking into all the specialties, except endo, and so I feel good about my interest in pursuing general dentistry as my career.

2.10.15
At our recent Dean's New Year Party, I was huddled in the clique known as the rhinos, and we were listening to Dr. Soeprono talk about how in your thirties, everything settles down and life really starts to come together. At the time, I, perhaps appearing a little cocky, responded that I feel like I'm already there. Thinking about it later, I can't say I've changed my mind. Not to say I have it all together (LOL, if only you knew), but I feel like life has really been coming together these past few months in clinic. Perhaps it's because school is much more streamlined and consistent compared to the hectic mess of a schedule I once knew as my life, but I just feel very strongly that this is where I'm meant to be.

2.16.15
What really is success? Is it the dentist that makes the most money? Is it the dentist that is the most loved? Is it the dentist who strikes the perfect work-life balance? I've been thinking a lot about what success really is lately, and what my goals should be in order to be a successful dentist. I think so far, I've concluded that success is ever changing. More about the journey than the destination, I think it's a concept that we are all chasing to help us be the best version of ourselves. Maybe immediately after I graduate, I will define success as being able to pay off my loan or start a practice. Maybe later in my career, it will be more about the work-life balance. Maybe a little later, it will be about trying to ward off ""dentist's hunchback"". Who knows?

On another note, I had oral surgery rotation last week and it ended up actually being...pretty cool. The faculty were pretty nice and understanding, for surgeons that is. I liked that it was fast paced, putting people out of pain, and not about being pretty per se. There was just something about getting down and dirty with relatively caveman instruments to literally just remove a problem that was strangely satisfying. I also got to assist with some interesting implant and sedation cases with the residents. During the week, several faculty and residents were saying I should consider going into surgery, because they thought I was a ""natural"". At the time, I was pretty flattered, and was like ""oh gosh, who ME?!""[acts coy and humble].  Later, when I thought about what they must have seen to make them think that, I think it really just boils down to who they liked working with in the operating rooms. I watched other students assist and saw some who were just completely zoned out, some who were MAJORLY sucking up, and some who were chatterboxes. I definitely made my best attempt to be helpful, less socially awkward [don't know if I succeeded at that one], but stay out of the way when things get serious. This teamwork is probably all it takes to be a ""natural"" in that sort of setting, considering most of the surgeries I watched were more of a team effort. So sadly, no, I'm not special and I'm not naturally gifted with supernatural surgeon hands. But I will take it as reassurance that my attempts at being socially not obnoxious were well received that day.

3.14.16

Clinic has been picking up lately. I recently got a few new patients who were referred from other patients so it's nice to know that some people trust me with their friends and family. I'm also working on my denture cases now, which is a steep learning curve. I'm almost resigned to thinking that the only way to learn how to do something right with dentures is to mess it up at least once first. Even when I read up from the old CR2 manual, it is so different doing VDO/VDR, bite registration, etc on a real person.

4.1.16

Clinic- So I haven't been having very good luck with endo lately. I've started 5 molar endos and have completed...NONE. I still have hope for two of them, but after several appointments spent on 3 of the maxillary first molar endos and then having to resort to referring to the endodontists, my optimism is a little reserved. I think I like what I've been able to do so far with it, but I don't like all of the guesswork involved with possibly missing an MB2, an extra root, not knowing if your working lengths are really and truly accurate, etc. Thank goodness I haven't had any new patient appointments this past week (only saw my regulars), because it was pretty hard to have my usual energy being sick.

Extracurricular- I'm excited to go to the National Oral Health Conference April 18th-20th :) It has been a while since I've been to an academic conference, but from what I remember, they are pretty good at motivating you about whatever the theme is.

Other- I finally have had some time this week to get organized again, because I got a little behind since spring break and being sick for the past week. As much as I love time off from school, it definitely makes me anxious when I come back because I feel like I forgot how to ""adult"".

My apologies for slacking heavily on my e-portfolio responsibilities. Overall, clinic has been great. I really enjoy that D3's are in clinic now, because I can recognize how far I've come over the past year when I can help some of them with little tips that I stumbled across this past year. I feel much more comfortable with the ""bread and butter"" of general dentistry, such as SRP, composite restorations, endo, crowns, and troubleshooting a few of the ""exceptions"". There is still a lot left to learn, but I am more confident in my work and can identify my areas of weakness better. Since I'm planning on working in general dentistry when I graduate, I've been trying to push myself more this year, slightly outside my comfort zone, to do things more independently, more accurately, and more efficiently. I want to continue to learn how to manage more complex situations in dentistry, for when things don't go exactly as planned, but I think this will come with time.",D4F

9.30.15
These past couple of months in clinic have been an exponential learning curve. I am learning how to adapt to a completely new environment and how to treat patients of my own. Between learning axium, learning the proper protocols for treatment planning, and learning about the various new dental materials available in clinic, I feel like I am learning a course's worth of information in each clinic session. I truly enjoy this part of my dental school experience the most, as I am fully engaged in speaking with patients and trying to tailor treatment plans to best suit each patient's needs. I've also had the opportunity to learn various techniques from watching faculty members mentoring other students. I hope these observations will help me perform procedures smoothly when I come across them in my own patient population.

For example, in clinic I had a patient who insisted on having an immediate denture made even though it was not covered by insurance and he had no visible front teeth to begin with, all crowns were extremely broken down due to decay. Faculty and I agreed that not only would this patient not benefit from an immediate denture as he had no teeth that required immediate replacement, he would also need a classic upper denture long term so to make an immediate would really be doing the patient a disservice.
