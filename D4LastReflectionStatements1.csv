Delivering the best possible care while being ethical at the same time is how I intend to on how I base my practice.  I have seen so many patients that had horrible dental work done, and its unfortunate that there are dentists that continue practicing like this.  I don't believe it is ethical to practice like this. The patients that come are trusting us with something precious, and we need to uphold our value of ethics.  All options need to be discussed, and the patients need to understand it to the best of their ability.",D4L
2,Q2a1zJef,Private Personal,14-04-17 18:06,18.1,"Sternberg's triangular theory of love states that with passion, commitment and intimacy consummate love is attainable. It is my belief that integrating these three components as my guiding values will ultimately lead to my idea of a consummate life: my triangular theory of success.  Indeed, it is my journey as a dental student that led me to what I believe is a consummate life.  As a dentist and as a woman, I yearn to continue my dental career within this triangular theory of success; satiating my passion for the dental discipline, committing myself to the healthcare profession, and building an intimate bond with my patients. Some believe that reaching perfection is unattainable, but there is something truly 'consummate' about dedicating yourself to something you love and developing the wisdom needed to treat patients with different needs and challenges.
My first year as a dental student was by far the most difficult, but it was also the most rewarding one given it was the validation of my love with the field. Midway through the semester I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and she became a reminder that I was not only going to school to fulfill my dreams, but also to fulfill hers. Thankfully there were no complications and I managed to maintain my pre-partum schedule and be a fulltime mom. Balancing being a student, wife and mother helped me to fully understand the power of my calling. I was backed by a loving and nurturing family that inspired me to dedicate myself to a career and that gave me the tools to be a versatile woman. I knew back then that I still had a long road ahead of me, but that nothing could stop me from reaching my goals.  
Along the academic road was entering clinic, an experience which marked me profoundly as an individual and as dental practitioner. Treating patients only cemented my desire to become a dentist, as it was through practice that I came to comprehend my devotion to working in the care of people. Your patients place all their trust in you and seeing that gave me the confidence I needed and served as a great motivator. Needless to say, I was immensely excited to take all my book wisdom and apply it to actual people. It was only until I began hands on work that I was able to apply my unique skills of dental artistry.  Once my patients began referring their friends and family members, I realized that not only did my patients have faith in me; they were witnesses to the high quality of my work. 
Four years have passed since I entered dental school, and on record this time shows the dedication I put into my education; however, this time was so much more than studying for me. In four years I transitioned into the woman I am today, learning how to juggle being a wife, mother, student and working woman. While my perseverance and determination were strong, there were moments when my inner struggles almost got the best of me. It wasn't easy putting all my focus on my career when there were people depending on me, and while there were plenty of sleepless nights and disappointments, I learned through this journey that nothing worth fighting for is easy. I came out knowing what I was capable of and that ultimately my resiliency would be the determinant of the outcomes in my life and my career. I am completely resolute on being a dental practitioner, on helping people, on accomplishing revolutionizing things within my field and looking back on my journey I realize that I have acquired the passion, commitment and intimacy within my concentration to say I have attained my idea of a consummate life",D4L
3,Q2a1zJef,Private Self Reflection,14-04-17 18:06,18.1,"What is the definition of a professional?  According to Merriam Webster, it is 'characterized by or conforming to the technical or ethical standards of a profession, exhibiting a courteous, conscientious, and generally businesslike manner in a workplace'.  I believe being a professional is also taking responsibility for your actions.  For example, I missed the peer assessment meeting last week, September 27, due to my two-year-old child being ill.  I needed to prioritize what was more important to me; the wellbeing of my child or attending the peer assessment meeting.  Of course I chose my child, as I believe, any mother would.  I emailed the instructor explaining the situation and that I would make up the absence any way I can.  
Being a professional also encompasses competency, knowledge, respect, honesty, and integrity.  Becoming competent takes years of experience.  We learn to turn problems into solutions.  Also, we never stop on building on our knowledge so that we can always improve on our skills.  As always, being respectful characterizes you as a person and as a professional.  Honesty and integrity I believe is of utmost importance because that way you build a trustful relationship.

7,Q3KOrarY,Ethic Reflection,17-04-17 3:05,3.083333333,"In treating patients in clinic the past few years, I have learned how to approach various situations that involve the patient making decisions on treatment or the dentist guiding the treatment plan. It is ultimately up to the patient to decide on the treatment, but as an acting health care professional, it is my job to ensure the patient understands what side effects and what potential consequences can arise from treatment. This ethical dilemma includes being respectful and accepting a patient's decision, even if it may not be one that is in the best interest of the patient's health. As long as these decisions are documented and the patient is well-informed, the patient can do as he or she pleases. I will also put my patient's desires, and health and oral health above my own personal desires. I will always document my procedures and any important events that occur during my patient's visit, so that I can legally protect myself and themselves, and so that the work is documented for future review.

I have learned how to brainstorm ideas with my colleagues and my faculty over complicated treatment plans, and have learned to work with dental hygienists and dental assistants so that we can more efficiently provide the best care for our patients. I have encountered many struggles, learning from my own mistakes or encountering situations with unforeseeable circumstances. However, it is through these struggles that I have gained that much more confidence in my competence and skills to treat others.

I feel like everyone is trying to meet the requirements and graduate and sometimes we may be tempted away from ethics but that is definitely a slippery slope that we should not go down.

I still feel I can be more organized. My work area still gets really messy after the treatment is done and sometimes I still forget all the supplies I need for that session. Out of all the clinical treatments we perform I still feel not as comfortable with endo and crown treatments. 

I think for a while I was losing sight of the patients I was seeing because I was being overwhelmed by my schedule but I am starting to learn to take a step back and really work on building that connection with all my patients new and old.

It also means how you present yourself and how you treat the people you are working with. For instance punctuality and respect are two important aspects that patients look for in a dentist aside from his/her technical abilities. A dentist that is unorganized or difficult to make appointments with is hard for the patient to trust in putting their oral health in. Also even though the dentist is the head of his/her practice, it takes a cohesive and supportive team of individuals to treat the dental patient properly. Thus, a dentist that does not present him/herself to the dental team in a professional manner will never gain their trust.

Not much has changed I still believe in what I wrote previously. 

One of the most important thing is to really listen to the patient's concerns. Don't approach a treatment session without an open mind, sometimes you need to adapt to the patient's needs. As I learned today, it is just important to know when not to start.",D4L

At this point I am thinking of going into a career where I am practicing part time as a pediatric dentist but also explore the public health side of our profession. I think there is large room to grow especially for finding ways to target areas that are not having access to dental outreaches/screenings.

I hope to go into a pediatric dental residency prepare me to come out practice in community dental center or clinics that serve the disadvantaged.

Yes it would be easier if a restoration would turn into a root canal so that I can get more endodontic experience, but I still cringe at the thought of possibly getting an exposure and then the patient would require either a root canal or an extraction.  One important lesson that I have learned in clinic is that ""I didn't create the cavity, but rather the patient did and I am only hear to try to remove the disease and save the tooth"".  When I first started in clinic I felt bad if I had to tell the patient that I couldn't restore the tooth and it needed to come out.

I still find it weird when patients refer to me as ""Dr"", and I am quick to tell them to call me ""Mike/Michael"" instead.  I have also noticed how I am always wanting to get patients with interesting or more complex cases.  Lately, I find that I am disinterested in doing simple restorations and cleanings.

At the time in D1 I didn't give it much thought, but now having gone through 4 years I fully understand and appreciate what he was talking about.  At times in D1 and D2 it seemed like the numerous exams, lab requirements and studying would never end; but somehow I prevailed.  Once I got into clinic I felt a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders as I didn't have to really worry too much about studying or taking exams, but instead got to put to practice all those long hours spent in the bench and simulation labs.

The burden of making a clinically sound decision, a decision that the patient expects will be a long term, sustainable solution. On the other end of the spectrum, it's a decision that abides by the ethics principles and values. I have had patients confide in me with medical and health related matters and furthermore ask for professional advice in regard to their wellbeing. This is something I do not take for granted and I intend to uphold the greatest level of confidentiality when it comes to patient care.

I have gotten better at ""putting myself in other's shoes"" and ""walking a mile in them.""  I have become more aware of what I am saying, how I am saying it, and how it is being perceived by my patients and those around me. I have developed professional relationships with colleagues, faculty, and mentors.

Over the course of clinic, these situations that I have witnessed have ranged from students working with specific faculty who will ""do the work"" for them, speaking (whether seriously or not) about intentionally pulping out on a tooth, to adjusting casts after it has been poured up instead of calling the patient back in. While all these situations range in ethical severity, one cannot help but think that small ethical transgressions can, and most probably, will lead to greater ethical transgressions. In my opinion, the culture of the class and school, where at times the perception is production matters over education, only serves to reinforce these ethical slights. During school I have learned a great deal regarding dentistry, however, I will take with me the ethical disposition that has been developed.

I often think that it is easy to always do the ""right"" thing, but when it comes to healthcare, not everything is so black and white. I am glad that we were given the proper training to make the right decisions in questionable situations.

One thing that I have learned about dental school is that you only get out of it what you put into it, and I want to put my best effort into it.

It ended up being squamous cell carcinoma. Another ethical situation I have noticed is when some patients try to pressure you into doing something that you may not want to do, or pressure you into making the procedure go faster. It is important for us to take our time and follow all of the steps to avoid making any possible mistakes. At the end of the day, if we follow what we believe to be ethical, we should be able to sleep better at night.",D4L

The dental profession holds a special position of trust amongst our community and society. Many times in dentistry the decisions we make are not, clear right or wrong, there are numerous gray areas we must come across. There are five fundamental principles that we are taught to follow, patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, and veracity. It is important that we abide by these standard of ethics.

I noticed in clinic from my past two years, what truly differentiates a good faculty from a great faculty is the way they are able to interact and communicate and show empathy toward the patients. Patients are not able to critique or judge our hands skills, but they are able to recognize when a healthcare provider really goes out of their way to care for them. 
Another matter that I would like to emphasize on is the importance of continue education and learning in the field of dentistry. As I approach graduation as a fourth year student I am looking forward to starting my general residency early summer to improve upon my weaknesses and strengths.

Unlike making a mistake in lab where I can always re-do the work, now with patients they have an option to not return or find a different provider. Therefore, it is important to minimize mistakes and be able to learn from them if we do make one.
Looking back at what I wrote as a third year, it shows that I not really competent yet at managing patients and their expectations.

There were two major observations that captivated me the most with the first being the importance of creativity. This was evident when developing a treatment plan and presenting it to each patient and the way they were handled were tremendously different based on the medical history, age and current oral condition of the patient. Secondly, the importance of hands on abilities intrigued me as well, as I was able to change my patient's appearance through the use of different dental treatments from simple composite bonding to porcelain veneers, fixed prosthodontics or fabricating a new denture. 
After finally completing second year of dental school and starting clinic I have come to realize the things we have learned the first two years are only the foundation or introduction to what's to come in this career. Everything we do in clinic builds on what was taught in classes. Therefore, to be a fully competent dentist we must build on what we know and add new things to what we have learned.

I began volunteering on an EMS ambulance as an EMT where we were once called to the scene of a 7-year old patient that had gotten plumbing cement stuck between his teeth. The OR had to await the response of the appropriate doctor to aid in treating with a meticulously skilled understanding of oral function and how the subtle nuances between the mixed dentition, surrounding tissues ,as well as growth considerations and prognosis would affect the young patient. The responsibility seemed immense, but was very well handled. As I begin to reflect on my own growth and the responsibility I will inherit. I feel prepared to begin. With my full scope of training at NYU in many clinical aspects of dentistry; whether it's the hours of ethical reflective seminars, hundreds of extractions in oral surgery or hours spent in the special patient care clinic I feel a well-rounded sense of initial training, more importantly I feel prepared to competently address the oral health needs of patients.",D4L

There is our first time with a handpiece and typodont, the first time we take an exam, the first time we meet a patient under our care, the first time we extract a tooth and one day soon; the first day as a doctor of dental surgery. The summation of the experiences cause me to reflect on my growth and achievements in clinical skill, diagnostic ability, ethical development and selflessness. The origins of the name doctor suggests one that teaches. As a doctor in the modern sense, one must competently and sensitively meet the needs of the community to which they serve, educate patients and collaborate with other healthcare professionals. Combining the total scheme of skills is a carefully executed symphony of competence. We are trained that oftentimes oral health is a window to ones overall health and inherently, this gives us a unique window of opportunity. An opportunity to restore more than a tooth, but to restore a small piece of humanity.",D4L

The role of a mid-level provider in dentistry is controversial. Many dentists feel threatened that a mid-level provider would take over the dentist job.

Debating with faculty when I thought there was another option, educating a patient who was adamant to not extract an infected tooth or who wanted a crown when the entire crown was missing or who wanted to retain a tooth with 90% bone loss.

I do hope that this teetering of the ethical boundary will not bleed into other areas, especially when the time comes to manage patients. I have heard and seen clinic procedures that are not ethical, just so students can do the procedures they want. I have learned the hard way that playing by the rules wont get you anywhere fast. As school nears the end, I realize that there are many many unethical people who will get diplomas. There are some unethical people who will go into great programs, whereas the more ethical people are left with dust.

I know that achieving my dental degree is only the first step in my career, but to build a great career is a daunting task.

Online assignment reflection: Being in a very intense 4 year dental program we constantly find ourselves multi-tasking. With clinical requirements and deadlines/ patients/ formatives/competencies/ didactic courses/applications/boards... etc it is very hard to ""shut off"" our multi-tasking and try focus on one thing. Yes, I agree the work suffers and I am physically and emotionally tired, but the countless deadlines make it nearly impossible to focus on one thing. The constant reminders of requirements, competencies, formatives on time prevents us from focusing on one thing alone. I agree with the podcast that we would be more efficient and less drained but does not seem possible in dental school. From today on I will try to focus on one thing rather than focus on multiple/ multitask and hope it will make me more efficient.",D4L

I read an article that was published in Korean magazine that when patient was presented to different dental clinics with a same x-ray image, the number of fillings that each dentist recommended actually differed. Besides this issue of surgical intervention of caries, I think dentists have so many other cases in which their ethnicity will be tested.

It first impression of being an ethical practitioner was not to do anything for my own profit alone. However, it did not take me too long to realize why there are such things as ethical 'dilemmas'. One of the dilemmas I remember was when I was being asked by a patient just before giving anesthesia 'how many times did you give injections?' (This was around the time started clinic). I actually told the patient that I have done it more than fifty times when it was actually little less than thirty times. The patient was still not very comfortable so I had to have an attending faculty watch me give the patient an infiltration.

I have tried my best to always put patient's interest and health first before anything else and to respect their rights for all their visits at our school whether it be during treatment planning, actual treatment or a simple consult.

I really like that the school forces us to address each and every problem and that patients get turned away if they don't want to adhere to those rules. I feel like this promotes proper practice of dentistry for when we graduate. If a patient has severely periodontally compromised mandibular teeth and wants a maxillary denture he's missing these teeth, according to protocol, we can't make him a maxillary denture without treating his compromised teeth first. I feel like this is such an important part of our education, because as a dentist, I am responsible for not just the state of a patient's oral health at the moment, but to make sure that after I treat any patient, that they don't eventually suffer because of something I failed to acknowledge.",D4L

It's unfortunate most people don't get to share this experience. Some people never had access to dental care at all during childhood and suffer now as adults because of it. As a dentist, I want to change the way people think about their oral health and give them a better dental experience. I will provide compassionate care personalized to the patient's needs and expectations in a comfortable environment. I  hope to maintain trusting relationships with patients in a long term setting and to be involved in making a difference in their lives. If I can help to improve someone's quality of life  by reducing their pain or giving them a functional, beautiful smile, I will feel that I have truly accomplished something of which I can be proud.",D4L

Based on what I have learned so far at NYUCD, I will be a health care provider who do not violate any ethical principles when providing service to the community and treating my patients in my practice.

During our ethics course we discussed principles such as autonomy, and non-maleficence, scenarios of ethical dilemmas, and recent events where dental professionals acted unethically.  When faced with an ethical dilemma, I am confident that I have the character, knowledge, and tools necessary to avoid violating ethical principles such as beneficence, non-maleficence, veracity, autonomy, and justice.

Next year in my GPR, I would like to apply my experiences and knowledge gained throughout school to my practice in my GPR. I feel that I still have much professional growth to accomplish, and am really looking forward to developing my skill set after graduation. I would also like to continue to be more involved in volunteering in my community, and helping to address the lack of access to care in dentistry. I've participated in some outreaches in the community and have really enjoyed them; in the future I would like to continue to participate in more outreaches in our local community, and help bridge the gap of access to care. From being in clinic, I realize there is a huge need for dentistry in underserved populations, and I would like to help address this.

I have heard many stories from faculty members or through my research online of ethical violations committed by dentists in practice. From adding surfaces to restorations to completing unnecessary treatment. As health professionals, we owe it to our patients to maintain the highest level of integrity. Patients do not possess the ability to interpret radiographs or detect clinical caries. They trust our clinical judgement and accept treatment based on what we tell them. This is a responsibility that I take very seriously. I strive to provide the highest level of care for all of my patients while ensuring to never violate any ethical principles. I have maintained a high level of integrity and ethics throughout my time at NYU. I will continue to do so as I embark into private practice; I owe it to myself and patients alike.",D4L

However, as the semester progressed this was no longer the case. I look forward to the second year as I know I will only continue to improve and strengthen my hand skills.

I am really enjoying dental school as a 2nd year dental student. I feel like the didactic courses are more related to the field of dentistry, and like the variety of the lab courses. I have grown especially fond of CR1 and CR2. My favorite exercises in CR1 would have to be crown preps while I thoroughly enjoyed the RPD portion of the CR2 course.

Third year is without a doubt my favorite thus far. Everyone says they come to dental school to help patients, but one does not truly realize the impact they can have on a person's oral health until they actually start treating patients. I have found clinic to be immensely gratifying. The ability to restore functionality to an edentulous patient is greatly satisfying to me. I look forward to the next year and the experiences and knowledge that will come with it.

I make that clear to my patience while managing their expectations. I will try to deliver this sort of treatment when I am in private practice.

At times it can be difficult as the patient may desire something that is not agreeable with my own ethics and views. Most recently, a patient wanted to have a tooth extracted where other options were more viable (due to financials). I felt conflicted between the autonomy and beneficence of this scenario and had to take time to think about it. Going through these experiences have definitely helped me in resolving these issues in an ethical manner and also appeasing to the patients.

When I am a working dentist, which will be in a few months, I believe that I will do my best to not over diagnose and to treat only that which needs to be treated. I don't think I will ever become the kind of dentist that pushes his patients into treatment which is excessive and unnecessary. There is more to life than making more money.",D4L

Most of the patients that come through NYU are a pleasure to deal with. They know that we are students, that we are trying our best to learn, and that we are treating them with compassion. I'm not sure what to expect of the real world of dentistry, but I hope that the ""paying"" patients out there are not too vicious.

There is a general distrust of dentists and the only way to reverse this is by treating every patient with courtesy and with professionalism.

The many ethics courses and morning treatment planning rounds has provided a lot of exposure to possible problems that dentist can encounter in the field and has been a good jumping off point to start thinking about how I would personally react and perform in these challenging scenarios. For example, what would you do in a situation in which you accidentally nick the patient's gums but they are under anesthesia and are unaware of this happening, or what do you do if the treatment plan the son prefers differs from the treatment plan his very elderly father would like for himself. With the many clinic requirements that are expected out of us, it also presents a very real scenario of how to balance what is expected from us by the school and what is expected from us by our patients.

Interacting with patients in a clinical setting, where often the line between dental student and dentist is blurred, has really provided numerous opportunities for me to develop the skills to convey professionalism to those around me. I have learned that a large part of being professional is just to be accountable, whether it be following up with a patient's treatment that may be taking longer than expected or taking the time to explain foreseeable complications that may arise before a procedure. This is sometimes harder said than done, as no one wants to call up a patient to tell them they have to come in for yet another final impression, or that the lab work that was sent back is not fitting. Also, it's incredible how being prepared before appointments and patiently responding to patients to make sure they understand the treatments outlined have a huge impact in reducing any anxiety they may have experienced towards their appointment. The patient relationships that I have developed in the past four years has really made the clinic experience a very gratifying one.",D4L

I hope to become a health care provider that can convey what I will be taught in these four years to my patients and staff with credibility and reliability. Being in clinic has really taught me a lot about becoming a professional in a health care setting. I have realized that this often means taking yourself emotionally out of a situation and acting to my best ability, as the role I have taken on as a health care provider. Many patients really rely on us to help them through whatever their dental situation may be and often, we are the only connection to them receiving the care they need.

It was up to us whether we approach our classmates and challenge their moral standards.

We all have requirements to meet and competencies to take and sometimes we may find ourselves drafting a more elaborate treatment plan than what the patient actually needs in order to benefit ourselves. However, as a health professional, I must keep in mind my patient's interests above my own. So far I have really kept to the ethical standards and have not done something for my patient that is against his or her own wishes. Ethics is communicating to the patient all the alternatives to a treatment plan and then let him or her decide what is going to be done.

Ethics is doing what's objectively right for the patient and trying to change the patient's own personal perspectives that may be detrimental to his or her own health. Being an ethical professional means doing what's morally and objectively right for the patient all the time despite conditions that can influence one's own personal opinions.

I had my first real struggle with ethics with a difficult patient. He was always very impatient and aggressive and I have to admit that in order to avoid him I wasn't as persistent in bringing him in for dental treatment. In one of his very last communications with me, he expressed his dissatisfaction with my work and how he was handled by his previous student dentists and he angrily told me that my number was blocked on his phone.

Now, I have discovered that communication is very important in enabling patients to understand me and to understand and appreciate the services I am providing for them. I've learned to be more expressive of myself and not just assume people know what I'm thinking of all the time.

Now that I have been treating patients in the clinic for a few months now, I have professionally matured as an empathetic, caring health professional. I am usually not one who speaks very slowly to express my thoughts; however, in front of my patients, I always take the time now to explain dental concepts to them to make sure they know what's going on and that they're comfortable with me before I proceed with a given procedure. Even though I'm still in the process of improving my skills in the various dental procedures I have never been exposed to before, I am still able to retain a friendly rapport with my patients so that they trust me to treat them. Their confidence in me enables me to feel much more comfortable with what I'm doing.

Throughout the progression of this year in clinic, I have developed into a more mature and understanding health professional.

I also learned to respect patient's right to make decision for themselves and incorporating that to treatment plans. Also I learn to take confidentiality more seriously.

Sometimes I wonder whether under our system, we could truly train ethical dentists. Dental school is definitely competitive and people come in with different motivations. Some people just want to get by, and some people wants to shoot for OMFS/Ortho. What I realize throughout the year was that NYUCD tests you on ""how to take the test"" instead of the class material. Many time, the material that were tested on the test were never covered by the professors and they were just reused questions from the quiz bank, perhaps developed by previous professors. Thus, in order to be the top of the class, you need to you have those past exams. Inevitably, students will find their way to get to those past exams and this was considered cheating. Perhaps, if the professors try to make up new questions every year (like the professors in undergrad), not only the letter grade will truly show a particular student's understanding in the material but also cheating will cease in the future.",D4L

Being in a clinical setting, the importance of ethics comes about in everyday situations. Working with patients, faculty, and along side other colleagues brings about many ethical challenges, and has taught me how to work through them.

Maintaining strong ethical values is necessary to not only uphold the name of our profession, but also that of our school, NYUCD.

I think being a professional is not just about one's education and abilities, but more so about how they make a patient feel. A true professional helps make a patient feel at ease and lessens their anxiety. They speak respectfully and seek to understand the patient's goals and desires regrading dental treatment. They are not just concerned about the procedure but more about the patient's well being and satisfaction.

I believe most healthy people have a conscience, but whether or not they strive to follow it is the key idea behind ethics.  It can be difficult to do the hard thing instead of the easy thing when your self interest tempts you to do the easy thing while your conscience warns you that you ought to do the hard thing instead because it is the right thing to do.  What keeps me in check is that at the end of the day I need to be able to look myself in the mirror and have respect for myself as an ethical human.

Experience with the actual dentistry is what fuels the development of the clinical skills, and patient interactions of all other kinds fuels the development of professional skills.  Among these professional skills are ethical practice, time management, treatment planning, and communication, among others.  I sometimes find time management and communication difficult in a very high stress environment, but I am working on improving myself.  Nobody is perfect.  I feel very confident with restorations, dentoalveolar surgery and simple extractions, simple periodontal procedures, and endodontics.  In my remaining time here, I plan to solidify these skills and to learn more about fixed and removable prosthetics, which I don't feel as confident with.  Luckily this school provides many opportunities in terms of both patients and faculty in gaining this experience.  Whenever I am unable to get these cases for myself, I try to assist my fellow students who are performing a procedure with which I am unfamiliar, and I am happy to accept an assistant when I find a colleague in a similar position.  This is a great way for everyone to maximize their clinical exposure and learning, and also for us to accustom ourselves to four handed dentistry.  As I approach the end of my education at NYUCD I appreciate how much I have learned and how much I have yet to learn.  I understand that there are things I can be taught in continuing education that I can and must learn to stay on top of the profession and it's evolving demands on me as the science and practice of dentistry advances.  I have remained in contact with friends of mine in the field and they are all satisfied with their work/life balance and with their profession.  I look forward to working on the outside and I even have some of my own career track plans.

Awareness of the importance of ethics allows one to be a true professional and excel in their care for an individual. The five basic ethical principles; veracity, justice, autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, are integral to the way a dentist should practice and acts as a guide to being a professional. Being truthful to the patient is one of the main things one can do as a healthcare provider; being fair is part of the oath we take, to not discriminate against who we treat; allowing the patient their own rights to their treatment is allowing them the right to make their own decisions and show that we are respectful of that; doing good for the patient is a defining role any healthcare provider has; and finally doing no harm is understanding that we are in control of informing the patient of their well being and we should not harm them in any way with treatments or any other matter.

There were times when I felt rushing through a procedure in order to meet the quota in order to graduate on time, which meant jeopardizing the patient care. It is very easy to settle in dentistry, and this is something I constantly critique myself of. I came to realize the bottom line of being ethical is simple, put your patient's well being above anything else. The choices we face with patients and the best treatment that we can provide sometimes conflict with patient's ability to afford and the patient's perception of what is needed. I did not understand how the steps of treatment planning had an integral part of ethics within its infrastructure. I do understand much better now of why us, the practitioners, need a firm understanding of ethical guidelines to make our treatment planning decision. Because when everything else sways, this ethic principle is firm and steady, and it should acts as the light house in the midst of a storm when one is clouded with questionable practice at times. After more than a year in the clinic, I now always present the best treatment option to my patient disregard their financial ability.

This includes possessing a solid understanding of foundational scientific knowledge and clinical skills to carry out safe and comfortable treatment plan. Also the possession of good communication skills, presentation skills and the humbleness to be able to receive feedbacks from co workers. This allows the success of team management, which is important for the well being of the patient. Moreover, one needs to be empathetic, allowing understanding and trust to be established between the doctor and patient, as well as the doctor and other professionals. Lastly, professionalism is a standard of conduct that one sets upon himself to always monitor his or her own progress throughout their career and other areas of their lives. It is in essence, a heightened sense of self awareness that allows one to always strive for higher standard in life.

Acting professionally means respect other's opinion and not be argumentative when your own opinion may differ.

As my time in school concludes, I feel comfortable treatment planning and I plan to continue to provide best patient care no matter what. I have learned that if you think something is weird, there is no shame in approaching a colleague or faculty for help. Despite this, I have become more self-reliant and now feel more comfortable making my own clinical judgements.  After my clinical exposure, I feel confident standing up for treatment plans that I believe in and advocating for my patients.",D4L

I hear many stories of students in the school not being ethical in their practice as they strive to reach the CEE requirement. Even as I am about to graduate, I worry about my requirements but vow to never allow myself to be unethical, even if in trouble with completing MDRs or CEES. This is something that personally has really upset me at the school - but I know that I never want to compromise my ethics in treating patients in order to keep me on track.

While this is a professional reflection, I do feel the burden of the administration constantly increasing my requirements and taking away procedures that grant CEE. The decisions seem arbitrary and put less focus on performing good dentistry and more focus on how to maximize points. Working in this environment has taught me a very valuable lesson: I never want to work in an institution or practice that I feel compromises the behaviors of my colleagues or makes me feel the way I have come to feel at NYU.

Throughout my time in clinic, I have worked with many faculty. I continue to seek advice and help from those who I respect and plan to learn as much as possible from them before I graduate. As I prepare to go out into practice, I have also seen faculty whose clinical choices and patient interactions I feel are not at the level of professionalism I have come to expect of myself. I find it a challenge when they approach me to treatment plan with and I now actively stand up for treatments I believe in. As a student, it is hard for me to go over their head and find another faculty to work with once they have approached me. That being said, I do my best to advocate for what I think is right and try not to let inappropriate faculty behaviors reflect on my own professionalism.",D4L

In order to practice with professionalism, one must employ integrity, competency, and demonstrate academic/skilled excellence in that specialized area. It is also crucial for the individual to keep current with research such that they can provide patients with current treatment/therapy using evidence-based practice. Furthermore, professionals are bound by professional codes, professional standards of practice, and ethical regulations (pertaining to both the public and the patient/public). These pillars of professionalism hold us accountable to our community and profession at large and ultimately serve to make us better dentists. Finally, as I am an anxious patient, I aim to make all my patients as comfortable as possible while receiving my care.

As I prepare to leave the pre-doctoral clinic, I feel competent to go and treat patients on my own. When I began, I was afraid to hold the instruments for a prophy and now I am able to independently give injections, do restorative procedures, SRP's etc. I am still get anxious with some procedures, including RCT and extractions, but feel comfortable enough to manage them on my own and know when I need to consult a specialist.

Furthermore, I have had the opportunity to treat patients for two years and implemented this knowledge into patient care. Prior to dental school, I also worked as a dental assistant and have seen first hand the ethical dilemmas that can arise. For example, failure to refer and/or diagnose an oral lesion could potentially lead to a lawsuit. This is one of many scenarios that could occur.

I began by gaining a background in the basic sciences and progressed to the clinic where I now treat patients on a daily basis. As a result, I have acquired an understanding for the reasoning behind the treatment rendered as well as experience in all facets of dentistry.

If you make a mistake, be honest and admit your wrong doings. If you witness others doing something they shouldn't, give them the chance to admit their mistake, and give them a second chance to do better next time. If you are unsure of something or are not competent, know your limits. I have tried to convey this in clinic. In one example, I thought I could improve upon a crown preparation. Instead of taking the final impression for a passable preparation, I further smoothed the margins so that the preparation could be closer to perfect in my eyes. I strive for the best possible outcome in all clinical situations, and I hope to maintain these standards as my learning continues in my General Practice Residency next year.",D4L

94,VhVdYgPh,Public Self Reflection,17-02-17 9:21,9.35,"Over time in dental school, I have understood that it is of utmost importance to have empathy when communicating with patients. Being compassionate and understanding will make it so the patient will feel comfortable and will return for care in the future. It is important to understand what the patient wants and educate them about what will be best for them, while keeping in mind that the goal is to make them happy and keep them healthy, merging what they want vs. what they need.  Communication in a professional manner is going to be a key to success as a competent, reliable health practitioner. I am realizing that the way in which I communicate to a colleague is different than how I communicate to a patient. I have tried to speak in a way that conveys that I am an educated health professional. There is a balance that comes in for good communication. I have even written my residency essay about communication, reflecting upon its importance. I am confident that I have improved in these skills, and I am certainly more cognizant of the impact that good communication has on being a doctor who my patients can trust.

Now that I have spent almost 2 years in clinic, it is even clearer to me how important these things are. I can also tell how effective communication with both patients and faculty is crucial. Additionally, proper documentation of all patient interactions in a professional manner will be a very important skill I would like to develop in clinic. In applying for residencies, I have written my personal statement about communication with patients. This is because I have gained a better understanding for just how important communication is.

Patients expect us as a profession to act in their best interest, including both in terms of their physical, esthetic, and financial wellbeing. Due to the asymmetry and knowledge and expertise, we must be vigilant that we are acting in the patient's interest at all times. Keeping high standards in terms of ethics aids in keeping the public trust and makes it easier for us to serve the public. Now that I am approaching the end of the fourth year, I have learned the importance of not just acting in the patient's interest with good intentions but also evaluating and being critical previous work and holding ourselves and our colleagues to the highest standards.",D4L

Every so often, I would be brisked away during a weekend off to the dental office. I would watch as my mother, a general dentist would re-cement the occasional temporary or fix the chipped tooth (so often just before a big event) prior to getting back to our weekend. There was always a bit of excitement in these out-of-the-ordinary trips, however, the most commotion came about when a patient would come into the office with an endodontic emergency. I was struck by how no single kind of person seemed immune to the way such a humble piece of the human anatomy could humble its bearers. It didn't matter if it was a young person my age or a towering tough guy, everyone was equally susceptible to tears from the pain. And, when these patients were treated and relieved of their pain, it was so satisfying to witness and made me wish that one day I could provide the same gracious service to other people.

As I reflect on my time during dental school, I have realized my wish particularly when managing patients who are anxious about dental care and/or in pain. Ask anyone who knows me and what they will say is that I am a calm and level-headed person. I believe it is this quality that has allowed me to have success with these patients and enjoy working with them to carry out treatment and get them out of pain. 

Looking towards my future, I have developed an interest in endodontics and I believe in having a solid foundation in general dentistry. I look forward to taking the skills I have learned here at the College and applying and enhancing them during my GPR at Woodhull Hospital starting this July.

There is a black and white, but there is also a grey. There is a thin line that once you cross, its hard to go back and at times you cant go back. I think each and everyone of us will come to a point in time and struggle with this. The difference will be how each and everyone one of us handles it and our perspectives that'll help us.
I think were more exposed now to what Dr. More speaks about in lecture. Were placed in an environment when patients can and have harassed their student dentist. When students become vulnerable and may slip into the slippery slope. I think it's difficult but I think with a good head on our shoulders and the right mindset were capable of overcoming that unethical door.
I think ethics/morals is so important. I've seen this when patients come in and say a dentist told me I needed a RCT, crown, implant, a lot of fillings, etc. But after a thorough examinations, it just turned out to be a few fillings and watching a few lesions.

I hope to become a competent dentist who is knowledgeable and skillful about this field. I want to be able to give back to others whether it is in NY or around the globe.

Side note: if NYUCD truly wants ethical students, they should stop slave driving us and forcing us to provide less than ideal tx just to meet a requirement.

No more hiding, no more conforming.  I will not let this school and this profession steal my identity.

In terms of my private self reflection on becoming a professional during my last few weeks in dental school, I have to say that even though I was tired, getting up in the morning to go to clinic, I was able to overlook this because I thought of myself as a professional in training.

In order to do your duty to society, you have to live up to their standards.

In terms of professional progress in my last few weeks of dental school, I still believe as professionals, we must stay that way our entire lives because even after one mishap.

In the four years of dental school, I've encountered several ethical dilemmas.  In the first few weeks of providing dental care for example, I was taking a series of radiographs.  I had failed to remember to place the lead apron on the patient for the first radiographs.  As soon as  I realized my mistake, I admitted my mistake and placed the lead apron on before continuing.

I feel as though I received an excellent clinical foundation and feel competent in my abilities to successfully prepare and restore various class preparations.

 6/29/15: After my first month in the clinic, I've treated several patients and have learned more and gained more confidence exponentially. Working on a real patient, manipulating the cheek and tongue for proper vision and access is all part of this learning process. Every day my knowledge base expands and I am more comfortable diagnosing and treating whatever my patient may need.

9/21/15: I feel even more confident than I did just a few months ago. I am way more comfortable working inside a real mouth and this has definitely increased my efficiency in the clinic. So far I have done a fixed PFM crown, a few fillings, several cleanings, and I am working on a few complete denture cases.

6/5/16: Now that I've been seeing patients in clinic for about 1 year now, I can confidently say that this past year has been the most i've learned out of any of the years. In the beginning, it was a little intimidating to jump right in and pretend we knew what we were doing. Now that I'm super comfortable treating patients, I just understand everything so much better. I've gotten much better at diagnosing my own patients, reading X rays, understanding medical complications, and my work has gotten more efficient. Now that I'm on a roll, have plenty of quality patients, and have a booked schedule, I'm looking forward to this last year of hard work in the clinic.

I am currently studying for the NBDE Part 2 which I will be taking this week. I have a busy schedule of patients, rotations, and honors aesthetics upon my return to clinic. I am also going to be preparing for the clinical live patient portion of the CDCA which will take place in February. There is only limited time left in NYUCD. I will do everything in my power to make these last few months count. I will devote myself to learning as much as possible, completing all of my requirements, and giving my patients the best dental care possible. I am most excited to learn digital dental photography and how to implant an entire photographic protocol into my patient exams.

2/24/17: I have successfully completed part 2 of the NBDE and all parts of the CDCA licensing exam. It feels great to have all of these exams behind me. I just completed the CEE requirement to graduate (4,480), which is an accomplishment, but I still have some MDR requirements to finish. The hardest part has been finding the actual patients who have the cases that I need. I'm currently spending a lot of time at my hospital rotation (Gouveneur's) and pediatric rotations are about to begin on Monday's until the end of the school year. It's been a long run at NYUCD, even though it feels like it went very fast. I've learned a ton, met some great people, but I am definitely ready to get out of here and continue my advanced training.

It's crazy to think that all of a sudden I'm just going to stop coming into the same building i've been in for the past four years and probably won't see many of the people here that often in the future. I feel a little more busy than I'd like to feel right now. There's a lot of little things to still accomplish and get ready for graduation.

I should be empathetic towards their discomfort and understand what they want most from dental care. Also, I should learn to establish long term patient relationship with my patients.

However, ethics can sometimes mean working in a gray area that is neither black nor white. This requires a state of mind that provides good judgment in deciding the balance between right and wrong, right and more right, or the lesser of two evils. The goal of being ethically aware is to act accordingly and appropriately. An example of ethics in dentistry is to know when to refer out because of one's limitations and weaknesses in doing certain procedures. This is a difficult task for some individuals because ego can give them a false sense of confidence. On the other hand, practicing dentistry also means to venture out of one's comfort zone slightly in order to grow clinically and to become a better dentist. While the risks and rewards of practicing dentistry must be assessed, it is important to keep the patient's best interest as a top priority. It is also important to be practical: dentistry can sometimes be about quantity over quality, especially in corporate dental settings.",D4L

It was then that I made a promise to God to devote my studies to my family and to incorporate my faith to motivate me in my studies.
Since then, however, my faith in God had diminished for whatever reasons and I stopped going to church due to the extreme demands of dental school. I feel like I am a changed person, but I'm not sure if it's for the better. Initially, I thought that the New York experience would allow me to improve my interpersonal skills by teaching me how to handle diversity, but I somewhat feel indifferent to it all, as my primary goal now is to balance schoolwork with family. My jobs are to be a hardworking student, loving husband, and wise father of two, so I have enough on my plate.

After being in clinic for some time now, I realize that talking about cars is much different from talking about one's health.

The situations where the prognosis isn't clear or if I feel that the situation is 50-50, I find difficult because I feel that the patient would like a sure answer rather than ""This is the situation, what would you like to do?"" and then they'll ask ""What do you think I should do?"" and I'll say that they can take time to think on it.",D4L

As health care professionals, our oath is to ""do no harm"" and this must always be adhered to.

For example, bridgework in a patient with no home care is probably not going to last in the long run, and things like this should be kept in mind for ethical treatment planning.

One of my most memorable cases includes a case which I observed in the pediatric clinic on the ninth floor. The patient was a nine-year-old girl who had significant decay on #19. The patient required root canal therapy. The mother had no interest in paying for the treatment, and wanted her daughter's tooth extracted. Her daughter was only nine, is defined as a minor, and was therefore not able to make her own decision.

You may feel that you are totally ethical and never did anything wrong, however someone may have a different perspective and approach ""ethical"" in a different manner. For example, I have been in this position in school a number of times and had to go in different directions depending on faculty I am working with. Nonetheless each experience has been a learning one. Root canal treatment is what I am referring to and avoiding the almighty pulp chamber. I had cases on an x ray that indicate definite endodontic treatment but through careful excavation I have been able to successfully indirect pulp cap teeth; patient is happy with no symptoms. Other cases I try to be conservative and leave a part of a seemingly healthy restoration intact and repair whats broken. Some say how can you be sure there are no caries underneath? Take out the entire filling and remove any unhealthy tooth structure. This risks irritating the pulp more. Also an indirect pulp cap may devitalize the tooth leading to necrosis and PARL in a few years. So which is the best way to go? remove everything or try to save as much as possible? depends on symptoms and diagnosis. But I find this area of ethics especially tricky.",D4L

An academic dishonesty would mean that I am cheating not only myself, but also my future patients.

However, sometimes it might be difficult to achieve a good balance between patients' autonomy and principle of non-maleficence, in which case we need to explain all different aspects and reasons behind the treatment plan to patients so they can understand better and more likely to accept appropriate treatment plans. If patient insists, we also have the right to refuse providing care if we believe patients' decision is causing harm to oneself. If an accident or unwanted event happens during a procedure, we are obligated to tell patient the truth even it puts us in a position likely to be sued. Also, in a situation where we don't have the proper training or ability to perform certain treatment procedures, we should refer patient to specialist for proper treatment.

By following these ethical principles, I will be a better clinician and will be able to serve my patients in the future. There are always difficult cases where different ethical principles come into conflict and learning how to ethically proceed is an important skill to have.

Being a professional involves possessing the correct knowledge to share with your patients in a respectful and effective manner. It is also important to dress professionally since patients can make many assumptions about a person from their appearance alone. By dressing and acting maturely, patients feel like they are in capable hands and will be open to listening to advice that is given. We should work to actively involve our patients in the treatment planning process, but we must make sure that we do not let them dictate the treatment plan to us.

It has been an amazing journey so far, and at times overwhelming. Over the past years, I have learned a lot of didactic knowledge and have honed my skills in a simulation laboratory setting. I am now treating patients and learning how to interact with them appropriately as a dental professional. I am also learning how treating people is different from working on plastic teeth on a simulated dummy. It is a wonderful change and I am enjoying the challenges that come along with it. I believe that every experience with a patient has a takeaway learning that can be used to better myself as a clinician. I hope to further expand my skills through the utilization of dental photography for documenting my cases for review later. As a D4 now, I provide the same high quality dentistry in a more efficient manner. Additionally, I try to take on more complex treatments to improve my clinical skills.",D4L

I have been fortunate that my first patients did not require the most difficult of procedures, only simple restorations, prophylaxis or scaling and root planing. Now things have picked up and I am simultaneously preparing for endodonic and prosthodontic procedures. It is challenging and exciting to learn how to balance everything and ensure that quality dentistry is performed in a timely manner. Time management is very important as I take on more patients, because I need to be able to see them all regularly to ensure completion of their treatment. It is also important that I remember to balance school work and my personal life. It is often very easy to become entirely wrapped up in patient care and didactic studying while forgetting to balance myself out by taking time off to relax and pursue hobbies and other interests.

That is why I always spend enough time to educate and ensure their full understanding before starting any treatment. Only then will they be more compliant to our suggestion. Another important principle is beneficence. It means we must strive to avoid providing treatments that are potentially harmful to the patients. It takes experience to select the optimal treatment.

(2015-6)
Communication with patients is very important. And to do well, I believe there is ethics behind it. If you try to make deliberate use of your position as a dentist and make unethical decisions in clinics, there seems to be always a bad consequence following the miscommunication with patients. I will be as honest and caring to my patients, and build a trustworthy relationship with my patients for the next year. (2016-7)
There were three things I mostly focused on during clinics regarding the ethics of dentistry. First, I respected patient's autonomy to decide what is the best for them, and this required a lot of explanations on my part because the patients needed to be aware of all details behind each possible treatment plan.Secondly, I followed the principle of non-maleficience well. I tried not to deliver any treatments that I don't think are necessary and be conservative in my treatments as much as I could. Lastly, I treated my patients all the same, following the ethical principle of veracity, so the patients do not feel left out and are not properly taken care of. (2017)",D4L

And my goal here is to give them even better smiles, smiles that are not just unaffected and big, but beautiful aesthetically. For such reason, I am most interested in cosmetic dentistry, more specifically in orthodontics and orthognathia, if my grades turn out to be on that level. (2015-6)

My goals became more distinct, and I am looking forward to participating in CTOR this year. I'd like to do ortho residency once I graduate, and it'd be my pride if I could achieve it during the four years at NYUCD. (2015-6) 

I recently realized that I like doing root canals, so my goals have become blurry because I am also considering endodontics as a possible option. (2016-7)

I have finally decided to work immediately after graduation as a general dentist, and within 3 years I will search out for opportunities in Ortho residency. Before I hit 35 years of age I will certainly return to Korea to practice so I will be able to live close by my friends and family for the rest of my life.

It has been a month seeing patients.

It takes time to carefully go through all that is required to do for each patient, but I realized that as you put more time and effort into the basic findings, the more you could find what is going on in patients' mouth correctly.

I think there should be stricter punishments for being caught as I think cheating devalues the dental education when people are able to continue these habits and do not face consequences.

I am also concerned with how people treat patients. I recognize that the school puts pressures on us. In order to graduate on time we have MDR requirements and a certain number of CEEs to complete. We must make patients a priority. It's not ethically sounds to see a patient as CEEs before seeing the patient as a person first. This is especially true with the the year coming to an end and the stress of the completion of MDRs.

In addition, I think that nonmaleficence, one of the bioethical principles we are taught to abide has environmental considerations. I think as responsible health care profressionals we should also be educated on the impact of our work on the environment. Environmental health impacts our patient's health. The waste and materials used in dentistry should be more critically looked at to ensure we are not doing harm to our current and future patients.


I have had to make a difficult realization that as much as it is important to help people, you shouldn't stop going out of your way for your patients. However, you need to realize that you cannot help people who are not ready to help themselves. I have chosen this role of helping provide health and wellness to patients, it is only ethical to continue to give a patient every opportunity to change their health around.

I have an interest in oral medicine as I have gained a lot of respect for the faculty that run the elective. The faculty have been great professors in OMPR and General Pathology. I also have a history of cancer in my family and feel like I would be good at empathizing with patients who have a suspicious lesion and have come in for a biopsy.
 I have looked into pediatrics as I completed 6 month clinic observation at Bellevue. Pediatrics may be something I consider after I have practiced general dentistry for a few years. Due to financial constraints and anxiousness to get out of school and get into practice, I will put this off and reevaluate in a few years whether it is something I would like to commit to.

I have learned that I need to become more independent in clinic.

74,UNeX45gI,Private Self Reflection,15-02-17 7:37,7.616666667,"I find the greatest challenge for me in attempting to be a professional is my nervousness and cautious nature when it comes to treating patients. I am not at my best if I don't feel confident and it is really challenging to feel confident when you're trying to complete a task you have only done once or twice before. I don't think nervousness and professionalism go hand in hand. A patient needs to feel that they can trust in their doctor and if they aren't confident in themselves how can a patient be confident and comfortable with the doctor? I have overcome this challenge with really developing strong relationships with my patients. I think my patients understand that I am very knowledgeable and that I am cautious as I do not want to make a mistake (and this stems from my interest in offering them the best possible care). I would much prefer if I could be confident in myself and be able to stay calm during a procedure but that will come with time and experience. I am confident that my nervousness will be reduced with time as it has already reduced in the passing months.

One of my more recent challenges when it comes to being nervous during treatment was completing a pulpotomy. The patient had very dense bone and the tooth was very hypersensitive due to inflammation. The patient was very sensitive as I approached the pulp but I knew that I had to reach the pulp and administer a intrapulpal injection as quickly as possible. The patient was moving his head every time I attempted to gain access. I was nervous he would hurt himself or myself. I overcame this challenge by thinking I that I wanted to minimize pain overall- some short term pain for long term relief.

I anticipate that I will be reviewing notes and podcasts often in the first few years of practice. It is one thing to learn knowledge prior to first hand experience and accessing information at the time of having a patient with a need in front of you.

The definition of a professional is simple to state but challenging to follow through on with every single patient in every single circumstance. Some days are harder than others- you're frustrated, you have challenges outside of the clinic that are on your mind. I think a professional is someone who tries their best to uphold a standard but recognizes his/her short comings. A professional knows when to step away from a situation and breathe and manage a situation to the best of their ability while recognizing the challenges. Working with the public can be challenging, people get frustrated, treatments can be difficult and though you may feel like stepping away, you need to continue and push through.

I am beginning to appreciate how there are multiple 'right ways' of doing things- this brings me some peace that if you are following evidence based research and fulfilling patient goals, you are practicing responsibly.

I  thought that after being in clinic for the past several months would allow me to be less nervous around my patients. I have made improvements but I am still a nervous and cautious person by nature. I am confident that with time it will lessen. I have already seen improvements. One week I can't figure out how exactly to remove a temporary crown, I am struggling with the removal of the cement etc but then just that next week I had a patient requiring the same treatment and after having experienced this once before, working with the temporary came very easily. It was after I gained confidence through experience did I feel prepared to see this second patient.

The more I think about it, I think that the reason that I am finding clinic challenging is that I am really trying my best to do it all. Becoming a dentist shouldn't be easy, you're working with people with strong personalities and opinions, there are barriers to care such as finances and insurance terminations, medical consults that put care on pause. It is not as simple as just doing the treatments that patients need. I am trying to give each patient the best possible care but it really can be a challenge sometimes, it is more than likely that there will be an unforseen roadblock. My next steps will be to anticipate roadblocks before they happen.

I was extremely challenged in my first oral surgery rotation. I felt that my previous encounter with my wisdom tooth extraction that left me traumatized.

I think I will spend a few years as a general dentist after graduation but will keep pediatrics as an option for the future if I am feeling unfulfilled as a 'kid friendly' general dentist. 

I am a secretary in the interdisciplinary education group- I am learning how important interdisciplinary work really is in detecting errors and finding a holistic care for the patient. I am continuing with this role into my 4th year. 

My goal for my 4th year is- to increase my speed in procedures while still being cautious and smart. I need to get quicker with restorative procedures. 

I've been working on my resume and cover letter, I am nearly ready to begin reaching out to employers. I want to begin working within a month of graduation. I keep hearing about students who recently have graduated and are only able to begin working in October, I am very conscious of the debt that has built up over the last few years.

Hawaii is the dream. I hope to be living and working there. I want to have a balaced lifestyle outside of working. I want to be able to stay fit outside all year round to keep me physically and mentally well to take on my first year in practice. Hawaii is becoming the reality. I have sent out my resume and cover letter through a colleague to the business manager at a clinic and I have been in touch with the manager about what the next steps are... And now I am in the signing process. I am still determining if I am the right fit. Living on a rural island is a bit daunting when you've become accustomed to the comforts of NYC.",D4L

I also intend to have an active role in the NYU community specifically in the realm of environmental conservation and sustainability.

I feel that I have been consistent with the goals that I have set for myself. I am content with the way I have continued to follow through with the intentions I had set during my first year of school. Over the last three years I have been involved with class council and student council as a Greening Representative. I have attended two research conferences to present on environmental health impacting patient health and how sustainability fits into dentistry. I am the secretary of the Interprofessional Educational Group that works to help students of all health professions to become more accustomed to working with each other. I am continuing in this role as secretary of IPEG in my 4th year of school. I have become invested in exploring the New York City. I love this city and feel so grateful for finding a balance between life and school. I am looking forward to continuing with an Honors in Oral Medicine which will allow me to explore a different direction in dentistry.

As I graduate in the coming months and go forward with my career, I intend to stay up with current research, educate myself on different dental materials and procedures and keep growing as a practitioner with everyday.

The whole structure of the exam was unethical in the way that it encouraged students to perform restorative dentistry on lesions that are a size that would respond well to remineralization, or to tell patients not to floss so that their calculus would be preserved for the exam. Prolonging treatment unnecessarily or providing treatment that was unnecessary was unethical. I can see how this would translate to dentists ignoring decay until the teeth required extensive work in order to get more money. It is a poor attitude to cultivate amongst emerging dentists but I felt that personally I want to introduce high caries risk protocol that can help patients avoid restorative treatment and preserve their tooth structure.",D4L

I hope that I can live up to my own high expectations as a dentist and a healthcare provider. I want to start doing continuing education courses right away so that I can start doing more complex procedures such as implant placement and restoration, oral sedation, bone grafting, and other procedures.

We do not have a list of guiding principles to look at in the moment, we don't have a group of peers to confer with, and often we don't even have much time to think about what to do. One thing I've learned quickly is that following all the rules blindly can actually be really unethical in certain situations. There is absultely no true answer. So I follow my own moral compass. I've been surprised how honest and candid some of my patients have been with me, and they put a huge amount of trust into me, and I value that trust.

And honestly, in some aspects, I don't think I'm there yet, which is why I'm excited to start my residency. I feel confident in my ability to do restorative work, or simple periodontal treatment, though I wish I could work more efficiently and quickly. But I don't feel that I am competent at more complex cases such as molar endo or more difficult extractions. But that's ok. I know what I don't know and I know I want to work at it.

Some days, I may provide excellent work, and I acknowledge that other days, some things may not be as amazing, but I feel that I am able to provide a consistent level of good results, and I've become confident because of it.

And while that still holds true, certain aspects of what we define professionalism as are integral to patient care. I can appreciate the importance of being on time, to set up for your patient and to not keep them waiting. I can understand how physical appearance and mannerisms can affect patients. Many of the people who come to see us are nervous, uncomfortable and truly scared, and it can be reassuring to see someone who presents themselves as a professional.
I'm excited to start my life as an independent dentist because I can will have more control on creating a professional environment for my patients.

I would barely touch a patient, and have to go run to the faculty to make sure I was on the right track. Now I am able to make many decisions by myself and work independently.

We might not be able to completely eliminate every moment of pain, but we can make our patients comfortable both physically and mentally. It's such a personal connection, and deeply gratifying.
Parts of school are really frustrating because I feel limited.

Before taking the competency, I wasn't nervous at all (compared to when I was a nervous wreck during D1 before practicals), because I was much more confident. I have still much to learn and practice, but I am happy with how I am progressing.

Update (3/13/16): I definitely feel more experienced with various procedures including post and core, as well as SRP.

Update (6/6/16): As I near the end of third year, I feel very confident in my ability to do simple restorative procedures such as class 1,2,3,4, and 5 restorations. As an interesting note, I have not worked with amalgam yet, even though that was one of the first things I was taught in dental school. I'm in the process of finishing my first complete denture. I want more experience in endodontics and fixed prosthodontics (although I'm starting another root canal later this week)

Update (11/9/16): I feel more confident in my clinical abilities. I find myself often helping other D3's with their procedures. I still want to get more experience in clinic as well as possibly a GPR, but I have come a long way. As of right now, I'm just trying to finish my requirements for graduation, while learning as much as I can while I am here at NYU dental.

Update (4/4/17): I am just finishing up my requirements and feel confident in my ability to perform all the dental procedures that we were taught here at NYU. Having said that, I know there is much more to learn and grow as a professional and I am excited for all my future experiences at my upcoming GPR at Montefiore hospital.",D4L

I didn't get a chance to write anything for the past few weeks, so I will try to sum it up.

July and August:

I started getting used to the way the clinic works and how axium works. I saw/felt what caries is. I learned (and am still learning) how to correctly identify caries based on the ICDAS system.
I learned that a restoration needs to be redone if the explorer 'sticks' by the margins of the restoration. I also learned that, based on color, you can have a 'leaky' restoration even if the margins seem to be in-tact (I'm still not so clear on this). But if the margins have a tight seal and the radiograph shows a radiolucency under the restoration, we need to think about what this might be other than caries.
I also learned how to cut off a crown when it becomes locked on a tooth (Dr. Moghadam was kind enough to sit and do it with me).

Week of 8/31

I learned that grinding/clenching can be a cause of widened PDL and not automatically an endo problem.

Week of 9/7

In oral surgery rotation and learned how to use extraction tools and how to properly extract a tooth.

Week of 9/14

I need to brush up on the differences and indications for when to use a prefab crown and when to use a cast post-core crown.

Week of 9/21

I learned the indications for PAs in 1A rotations
I learned how to properly do RCT
I made the mistake of not paying attention to detail before a tx, during a tx, and after a tx
I learned how to do proper tests/diagnosis when a patient presents to the clinic in pain

Week of 9/28
I learned the proper indications for diagnosis of emergency tx when a patient is in pain.

Week of 10/05
My patient this week came in with very deep caries. The caries was very black and I want to know why that happened. It ended up needing a root canal and I didn't really see why. Endo and general faculty said that the decay was circumferential around the canal, so I guess I just need to see more caries to understand.

Over the next 2 days I had no patients or cancellations so I helped out a lot in the clinic. I realized that I was able to think on my feet much better when it's not my patient. I keep getting flustered when I present a case to faculty...I need to work on that. I also realized that I have a much better understanding of prefabs and cast posts and when they are indicated.

I had a patient at the end of the week that I Tx planned with Dr. Soeprono. I realized that I feel very lost when I'm checking for caries and open margins on restorations and crowns. Unless it's blatant, my caries and open margin diagnosis is usually incorrect. I guess this is normal, but it's not reassuring. Thankfully Dr. Soeprono is very understanding when it comes to this situation.

Week of 10/12
My first patient of the week is my most complicated case and it's been overwhelming. I work very slowly when I'm treating him and it's hard to break that bad rhythm. I'm trying to be more prepared before I see the patient, but I feel like it's not working. Whenever a situation arises that's slightly different from the standard, I shut down and run to faculty. I feel like if I try to deal with the situation on my own then I might do something wrong or that I'm making a bad judgment call. I've been working with Dr. Moghadam she told me that she believes I know more than I think and that I should take more initiative and have more confidence when encountering slightly new situations (a situation I should be able to handle).

I had another patient that came in as an emergency and I should have known what to do to diagnose and treat the chief concern. I need to relax and keep a clear head when diagnosing.

Another patient this week was a little concerned because the prophy didn't take as long as usual. I found that amusing because I thought that it took me longer than usual because of the amount of calculus/plaque.

Week of 10/19

I didn't have many patients this week, so I spent my time observing other procedures and asking D4s misc question regarding fixed and removable pros.

I had a Class II restoration this week and I spent too much time trying to be conservative. The restoration was deep and I was very worried that I was going to hit the pulp. The restoration went well in the end.

Week of 10/26

I had to cut off a crown and redo a crown prep for a survey crown. Cutting off the crown was easier than I thought, but prepping the tooth was not. I also had trouble making a temp and faculty had to jump in and do it for me so I could end on time. I don't like when the faculty has to do this because it shows that I am not prepared enough. I know what I did wrong and hopefully I've moved passed those mistakes.

I had a restoration today that was deep and the patient was having pain once I reached the caries. Faculty tried to help get the patient anesthetized, but it didn't work. I'm curious as to why this happened as well as how to properly anesthetize the patient in this situation

I also had a few comprehensive exams to do this week and I'm not too happy about them. Diagnosing caries is very frustrating for me. Before I leave, I want to know how to diagnose caries based on ICDAS, but faculty seem to be split on this. I hear from the majority of faculty that the only way to clinically diagnose caries (unless there's gross cavitation) is by seeing if an explorer sticks. There are only a few faculty that go according to ICDAS and unfortunately it's frustrating.

Week of 11/2

This was an uneventful week since I didn't have many patients. I had a patient with the most calculus I had ever come across yet. I found that using the hand scalers was actually more effective in cleaning the supragingival calculus. It was more efficient and less painful for the patient (she is very sensitive to begin with).

I had a patient that needed a restoration done, but he came late so I only took impressions to make an occlusal guard (I'm realizing lately that I should take impressions of every patient I have at the first visit, this makes things easier down the line for subsequent treatments).

My patient came this week to have one of his teeth evaluated for RCT. The patient refused the treatment and much rather wanted to have it extracted instead. We went through the risks and benefits of both options and he decided on extraction. Dr. Soeprono made it very clear that everything must be well documented in the note (I can see this as being a good habit to develop so it doesn't come back to bite you in private practice).

Week of 11/9

I started a treatment of complete upper and lower dentures for a patient this week. On the one hand I have a good grasp on what needs to be done, but on the other hand I kind of feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. Border molding seems like a mystery to me of how it's done properly because we've never had real muscles and tissue to actually work with yet. I keep making it a point to ask Dr. Comut what he's looking for whenever I show him an impression, custom tray, border molding, etc. so I can understand what to look for myself even if I did it right by accident.

Week of 11/16

I had a patient this week that has a mouth full of caries and broken teeth. I felt very overwhelmed when I was doing the tx pl. I ended up speaking with Dr. Watson the next day when she was free to see where to go in the tx pl and I felt like I had a clearer picture of what to do and what to look for. I see that I need to understand when a tooth needs to be extracted and when a tooth should be saved (I can see that this depends on many factors, but I need a good system for determining this).

Also, I had a patient that presented with pain a few weeks ago and we diagnosed it as reversible pulpitis. We put IRM and it was less painful. We now took out the IRM and endo took a look to see if there are any fractures (which I learned can present as a dark line because bacteria might be stuck in the fracture). No fracture, but endo said to pack the composite slowly and incrementally so that there are no voids (some people are apparently more sensitive when it comes to having a filling and there being tiny voids).

I continued border molding this week. I suck. But I feel like I'm slowly getting the hang of it.


Week of  11/23

A patient came in this week complaining of pain. I really suck at treating emergency patients. I need to have the routine down of what to look for and what to ask. On the bright side, she was medically complex and I knew how to properly go about her tx and med consult.

Another patient came in this week with a totally bombed out third molar. I still don't have a handle on how we look at third molars. I thought the tooth could be saved, but the faculty immediately said it should be extracted because it's very bombed out AND it's a third molar.

I also continued border molding this week. I first had to adjust the custom tray properly. Dr. Comut showed me how to do this and it was super helpful. I really understood what he was trying to do and I feel like this really helped me. I hope I can reproduce this in other patients.

Week of 11/30

I had a patient this week that has severe periodontitis. He had a lot of crown and bridge work done and faculty said that he really just needs a full mouth SRP. I see why this was the case because his teeth were not mobile and it seemed better to leave everything along than to do a bunch of extractions. The patient also didn't want to have any teeth extracted. I asked perio about this later and I now understand that if a tooth has furcation involvement or severe bone loss/mobility, the patient is subject to developing an infection/abcess/cellulitis due to the bacteria trapped inside.
I started the SRP this week and it went pretty well.

Week of 12/07

I saw a sinus tract this week and it didn't look like I though it would. The pictures were were shown in class was just of a hole, but in the clinic it looked like a papule and you have to poke through it to trace the tract.


I had a patient come in for tx planning, but it was a disaster. I was bounced around from perio to pros and getting different opinions. I presented the case to Dr. Soeprono and that did not go well either. Dr. Soeprono was nice enough to walk me through the case and explain to me why Perio came up with the diagnosis that they did. I need to have a more though out opinion of what the tx pl should be before I come to faculty so I can learn something if I'm wrong.

I did a restoration this week that started as a class V but turned into a restoration that wen from facial to lingual. Interestingly we decided to not break contact and do the restoration from underneath. It took me a really long time and my back and butt were hurting, but Dr. Polokoff said I did a really good job and it was a hard restoration for anyone to do. He said I'll be one of the good D4s. That was nice.

Also, delivering an occlusal guard was easier than I thought.

Week of 12/14

I had a bunch of cancellations this week, but the main thing was border molding. I'm so slow and it's taking forever. The patient is also complaining of pain a lot, even when pros works with her. I'm learning new tricks here and there, but overall I think I just need to be more aggressive and confident in what I'm looking for.

Week of 1/4

My most complex patient is getting harder to handle. His mouth is just falling apart. His temp keeps coming off and now one of his crowns that he had done a year ago just broke off. I'm emailing back and forth between Dr. Soeprono and Dr. Moghadam to see what to do. It's kind of stressful, but I'm also learning a lot from the case...especially the fact that I must be faster in doing treatment.

Week of 1/11

I was in perio clinic all week. I got to see how to place bone grafts and implants. I also saw immediate implant placements. It was not what I thought it would be. I though it would be more guided, but it just seems like they have an idea of what angle to place the implant and they drill the hole.

Week of 1/18

I finally made the new treatment plan for my most complex patient. I sent work up to the lab, but it got sent back for overlooked details. I even had to go up to the lab with Dr. Moghadam last Friday to straighten something out. I'm trying my hardest to get this treatment done as quickly as possible.

Week of 1/25

I had a paient this week with an enormous BP reading and it showed me how important it is for a dentist to actually record vitals. After that experience, a few patients mentioned to me that they discovered they had high BP from coming to NYU for a dental checkup. I'd like to take this lesson with me throughout my career.

I did a class II on friday and it was a redo of an old restoration. The prep and restoration went really well and I was happy with it, but it took me way too long. I haven't done that many class IIs, but I need to be cognizant of the fact that I need to be more efficient. I'm way to conservative when I know I shouldn't be (even though I think being conservative is a good trait in its proper setting).

I had some cancellations this week, so I spent some of my free time speaking with Dr. Mohajer to get a better understanding of when we diagnose a tooth as hopeless. This was extremely helpful and I feel like I'm more aware of factors at play that would compromise the health of a tooth.

Week of 2/1

I had a few prophys this week. Those were fine.

I also had a periodic exam to do and I feel like I'm getting more comprehensive with my exams as well as getting faster.

I placed a post this week and I felt very prepared beforehand. However, doing the procedure was very different than preparing for it. Like my class II last week, I was hesitant to work as quickly as I could because of being afraid to perforate the root while taking out the GP. I had a little help from faculty, but overall I feel much more confident now that I went through the procedure.

I had to tx pl with Dr. Soeprono with a patient that had several phases in his tx pl. I saw that I was confused as to how to phase/sequence certain treatments, but Dr. Soeprono walked me through it and I now have a better understanding of phasing while tx planning and why it's so important. I want to be more cognizant of how to phase procedures from now on. Specifically, I was surprised to see that an extraction can be phased as pros (4) and not just disease control (2) based on the comprehensive tx pl. So this will ultimately have an effect on the order of treatments done. I was also pretty happy that I was able to walk through the treatment with my patient, explain it well, and have him see why the treatment plan was ideal for his oral health.",D4L

For instance, one faculty member may tell a patient that they can ""get away"" with doing a lesser procedure, while another faculty member, perhaps a specialist, will disagree and say that a more difficult/costly procedure is necessary. Now the student is in a bind as how to explain the treatment plans to the patient, and perhaps not relay all the information accurately in an attempt to finish on time, etc. This can border on unethical, as the patient may not understand the various alternatives adequately.

I think it is important to keep your word as a dentist, by being honest with patients and having strong morals and core values. A good practice should be founded on those principles in order to best serve the needs of the patients.

I think while we have this ethical responsibility to the patient, they also have some sort of ethical responsibility to us to tell us the whole truth. Some patients clearly don't floss and come to clinic lying about flossing. However, I do believe as a good dentist, I should teach them the proper OHI and flossing so they can do it in case they want to change. It is for their own good and maybe it won't help now, but may help down the road.

As D4, I have come across multiple situations where I was in an ethical situation of satisfying requirements versus doing what is best for patient.

Even though this year might get really tough, I want to maintain my hard work and strive to do the best. I want to try to attend as much lectures as I can, go to as many interesting talks as I can and learn how to do better in lab. This year, I will try to take pics and put them in e-portfolio. I also want to do my best in the basic sciences.

I also know that being a professional takes time, and that I have a long way to go before I even fully understand what being a professional really means.

I think it's true that as professional as I want to be, some patients are uncooperative and I'm learning to distinguish when they are being unreasonable and when I could improve myself in some areas. I think it's definitely a learning process. Some patients will just trust me right away, sit down and open their mouths and let me do whatever to their teeth. Others are shopping around or have this initial impression of NYU which is hard to break. Still others come in thinking this school is there to give them just a cleaning and expect me to do it without a treatment plan. It's definitely a lot of managing people's expectations and being honest with myself and with the patient on how much to get done.

Patient management is definitely an area to improve on. There are multiple difficult patients in the dental clinic and I want to do my best to interact with these patients in a positive and professional manner.

However, I do understand that it takes time to build trust amongst the patients and that maybe some patients are not as cooperative. I just want to be the most professional I can be, so that I know I did my best to treat patients both ethically and clinically.

I've learned a lot about professionalism through interacting with patients in the clinic in D3. For example, first impressions make a big difference and some patients are just more trusting than others. A lot of the times, it is how I come across, my body language and my tone of voice and whether I actually listen to their concerns. Overall showing that I am a caring and empathetic professional is key to success in my opinion.

In D4, everything is coming to an end, but being a professional is just the beginning. I see a long path to becoming a dental professional, and one which takes a lot of care, work and continuous development.

It requires constant reflection and improvements.",D4L

I have worked on everything from class I-IV and V. I have learned so much from my mistakes, from the faculty who gave me constructive criticism and from the different techniques taught by the faculty.

In clinic, it is a long road to graduation and I'm beginning to see how long this journey truly is.  I have made progress so far since the start of the summer. I came in not knowing anything (couldn't even take a proper x ray or use Axium) and progressed to being faster with Xrays and spending less time making mistakes on Axium. Treatment planning became a bit easier and I am learning more and more from the faculty each day. I guess the most exciting part is actually doing the procedure and seeing how to make an access or prep. It was really a long way to go before I truly become proficient. For now, it is making sure each step is done right and learning how to diagnose and treat each patient.

There is still a long road to being a dentist. I am seeing as I grow as a D4 that the road is even longer. Once I graduate, the road is longer still.

I want to improve communication with my peers and patients, and accept constructive criticism.

As a D2, I would like to add that as I have progressed into dental school, I would like to further develop my skills in the bench/sim lab and apply it to the clinic. I know learning new skills is not easy, so I would like to document and show my progress in eportfolio as I learn these skills so as to understand how I am improving my technique. I think the best thing to do is to develop an eye for why my preps may not be perfect and develop an understanding of how to get to doing the best preps out there. Also, I would like to keep up to date with the latest developments in dental research so that I am a well-rounded dentist whom patients can trust to give them evidence based practice.

This has provided ethical problems such as those presented when choosing a case for our D4 papers. Whereas most of the D4s I spoke to from other GPs were using their ICP case of the paper, although it had not been explicitly forbidden, I suspected my own GPD would discourage this. To surmount the issue I did use my ICP subject, but I composed and researched a new PICO.

2015: When we were in orientation we were advised to seek out old exams from students in the year above us. At various points during the first two years we are also told that old exams are often obtained by duplicitous means and that passing them around may be considered a violation. I will confess, there were several instances when having access to old exams made a big difference in my academic performance. Now that the bulk of the didactics are over with, I have formed a strong opinion about the issue of old material. All old exams should be released. Course directors should expect that their exams will be released, that students have all old exams. To do otherwise can not but strike me as lazy. The ultimate result of full exam distribution will no doubt be a library of a few hundred questions for each major exam in each subject.

Fall of D3 update: 
      It felt great to pass the boards, hard to say if that celebration is cooled a bit knowing everyone passed, makes it seem less special somehow, even so, it was a very difficult exam. I'm far more enthusiastic about the 2nd two years of dental school than I was about the first. Aside from the thrill of being in clinic and treating people, even our lectures are more interesting by simple virtue of seeming more immediately relevant to our careers. One very interesting thing I've noticed: despite all the effort we make to be formal and follow protocols, there remains a wide margin of error in diagnosis and treatment. I know well which supervising doctors to ask for a treatment plan review if I don't want to do a restoration on a tooth, and which ones to approach if I do want to restore, even the smallest aberrations.  The old saying is very true: get two dentists to suggest diagnosis and treatment, and you'll get at least three opinions. 

End of D1 Update:
      It's more difficult than I thought it would be, or perhaps I'm worse at managing my time than I thought I was. Regardless, my original goals are largely unchanged. I'll also add that towards the end of the year we were given a presentation on lasers, those are techniques I'd like to learn. 

      Everyone thinks I want to be a dentist because of sculpture. I'm lucky to already have hand-skills, that's the reason I believed I could get through dental school. It has occurred to me, that another, huge reason I want to be a dentist is because  of how much I've always hated going to the dentist. People who are afraid of dentists (most people) will recognize my empathy, and take comfort. It's hubris, believing I can be a likable thing that nobody likes, nonetheless, I'm in good company.

97,VHWnJyA=,Ethic Reflection,15-03-17 7:10,7.166666667,"While it is important to provide efficient and quality care every day, we must do this within the ethical guidelines of dentistry. This includes always doing what is best for our patient, avoiding doing anything that may cause harm to our patient, making sure our patient is always properly informed to make his/her decision to the best of their ability, always giving patients a full and honest disclosure, and always respecting confidentiality and doing what you say you will do",D4L
98,VHWnJyA=,Private Personal,15-03-17 7:18,7.3,"During the last phase of dental school, I have tried to improve my efficiency and maximize my productivity everyday. Additionally, I always try to maintain a professional attitude. This includes preparing diligently for each and every appointment, making sure I know what to do with each step, and managing the expectations of my patient while also treating them with respect. This helps me maximize my effort everyday.",D4L
99,VHWnJyA=,Private Self Reflection,15-03-17 7:07,7.116666667,"As I go through each day of dental school, I learn more and more about what it means to be a professional. I believe that as much as anything, it means to continue learning and continue to want to learn more and more about your profession and how to master it. This is the approach I take when I come to clinic everyday. I try to prepare as much as I can before hand and learn as much as I can before I begin a new procedure. But most of the learning comes from actually doing that procedure. It is important to really pay attention to detail during our time in clinic, because every day and every appointment can be an opportunity to learn something new, and this is an opportunity that we must cherish and take advantage of.",D4L
100,VHWnJyA=,Public Self Reflection,15-03-17 7:07,7.116666667,"From my first few weeks in school, I can tell that dental school is much more than just learning dental anatomy or knowing how to properly perform different procedures. It is about carrying yourself in a certain manner and knowing how to communicate with others. It is about approaching every task with the right preparation and knowing how to manage time properly. As I have just finished my undergraduate education in May, it is certainly a bit of a transition period from the casual lifestyle of a college student to a more professional atmosphere. Even though I am younger than most of my peers, I certainly believe I am mature enough to make the right adjustments and become a true professional.

EDIT 9/23/15
After looking at my public self reflection two years later, everything I wrote about core professional values still holds true, perhaps even moreso now that I am in clinic. Preparation is everything, and it has been very important for me to go to clinic everyday with an idea of what I hope to accomplish and a plan on how I will accomplish it. It is also just as important to be able to communicate with patients efficiently and in a way where they feel comfortable with everything you are doing. This part has come most easily to me throughout clinic, and I have learned a lot about from Dr. Soeprono and all the faculty on how to communicate with patients and come prepared to clinic everyday

Maintaining a professional attitude is very important in having success everyday in clinic. This includes treating every appointment with the highest level of preparation and attention, knowing what outcomes you are looking for with each treatment, and always treating patients with respect and care. I have become much better at this throughout the past couple years.",D4L
101,VHWnJyA=,Professional Progress,15-03-17 7:12,7.2,"Dental school has been progressing nicely and I have grown as a professional in the process. Tomorrow I am delivering my first denture and am excited to see how it fits and feels for the patient. Every week I am taking on new cases, most of which are interesting and all of which are great learning experiences. In the process, I have become a better problem solver and my clinical skills have improved as well.

I feel I have progressed in a number of areas over the past couple years. I have learned new techniques for removable and fixed procedures, while improving my efficiency in restorative techniques. The main thing for me right now is to gain more experience seeing patients and improving how proficiently I can deliver care. I am very much looking forward to starting a general practice residency, where I will see a much higher volume of patients and become more accustomed to the everyday challenges of dentistry",D4L
102,VHWnJyA=,Public Personal,15-03-17 7:05,7.083333333,"In order to become a skilled dental practitioner, I will use these four years of school to gain professional competence and strive to perfect my craft. In the process, I will make many new friends and establish a network among my peers. I will develop teamwork skills and learn how to communicate effectively with both peers and patients. I will be active in both research and community outreach programs, whether local or international. Above all, I will always stick to my values and make ethical decisions.

103,WKcAN28=,Ethic Reflection,26-02-17 14:36,14.6,"Various aspects exist in the world of dentistry, many of which do not come to mind right away. Besides the clinical and business aspects of dentistry, we must also be aware that ethics plays a huge role in becoming a valued practitioner. Ethical misconduct is not only morally incorrect but also shapes the kind of reputation that a dentist makes for himself. Furthermore, it is not solely limited to the practice of dentistry, but in all fields and career choices.I believe that NYU has done a wonderful job of educating their students in the pillars of ethical conduct. Such concepts are autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, veracity and justice. After only 2 years in clinic, I have had countless encounters where these concepts come into play and thanks to NYU, I believe that I have made the right choices in most of these difficult situations. Of course, I do not think I am perfect and have had my slip-ups, but I recognize them and try to work to improve every single day.",D4L
104,WKcAN28=,Private Personal,26-02-17 14:26,14.43333333,"After four years of dental school I would like to leave with the proper technical training and education necessary to practice dentistry as well as being proficient with the science behind it. I would like to perfect my interpersonal skills and be able to properly educate and communicate with patients and colleagues. I want everyone that I interact with to feel absolutely comfortable with me working on them, or working with them. I would also like to make valuable and reliable friendships here at dental school. I want to gain the proper knowledge and leadership skills that are necessary for practice management. I hope to systematically practice self-evaluation techniques and promote feedback from patients as well as employees on the content of my work, so that I would be able to constantly improve the quality and integrity of my profession.

It is also about being responsible for your actions. I know that at my time at NYUCD, there will be many times where I will not be 100% satisfied with my work, or even completely mess up, but I recognize that it is important to keep cool and stay professional. I hope to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to be able to correct my errors or find someone with better expertise to help or take over. Being a professional means constantly assessing yourself and your work, I hope to be able to critically judge the work that I do, in addition to receiving feedback from my co-workers and team members.

I am especially happy because I've been learning dentistry at a pace that is incomparable to what I gained from the classroom. I feel that I learn best with a hands on approach and its been working quite well for me. Of course, no one is perfect, and in the midst of my excitement, I may have gotten ahead of myself with a few instances, and underestimated the process of transitioning into clinic in other instances, but with each minor altercation, I have taken away invaluable lessons that will stay with me forever. One of the snags I've run into in clinic is timing. I have found myself running passed the allotted time for appointments. I've found that it's usually because I wait for the faculty too long or dont use my time as efficiently as I should. Since this realization, I've made an effort to set time markers for myself to make me more aware of what I have done, in what amount of time, and how much I have left to do in a certain time as well. This has really helped me get on track and work much more efficiently.",D4L

Update: 2/2017
Fourth of dental school is quickly approaching and I can confidently say that I've learned and grown so much in the past years. From managing my time efficiently, building clinical skills, pushing myself mentally and physically, I am proud of the person I have grown up to be. With every experience, positive or negative, there is always a learning opportunity.",D4L
111,WKtLvsDc,Private Self Reflection,23-04-17 16:00,16,"I want to reflect on my oral surgery rotation. It was slow in the beginning but as we got the hang of how procedures are done in the clinic, I learned a lot from the hands on opportunity. From non-surgical to surgical extractions, I was given the opportunity to apply what I had learned from simulation and videos to human beings. Not only did I learn about the procedure itself but learned a great deal about my abilities, skills and self improvement.",D4L
112,WKtLvsDc,Public Self Reflection,26-02-17 11:01,11.01666667,"There are many instances in clinic where I find myself overwhelmed with small details and I lose focus of the end goal. Treatment planning is complex and requires experience to execute successfully. Rather than focusing all my attention and the little details, I'm learning to think critically and assess the overall treatment of the patient.

Update: 2/2017
I'm beginning to understand that dentistry encompasses all things from hand skills, communication and business management. In order to be a successful professional, one needs to acknowledge  the importance of each one of these principles and properly utilize them in order to optimize patient care.",D4L

115,WL0bjYI=,Ethic Reflection,08-04-17 13:00,13,"My two years of experience at the NYUCD clinic has given me great exposure to ethical dilemmas by providing an environment that directly puts personal interests of the student doctors in conflict with the desired health outcomes of the patients. While it's unfortunate that we have an environment that sometimes fosters a conflict of interest, I believe this is just a preview of what's to come. CE's and MDR's will be exchanged for a cash equivalent in our daily practices and the deadlines of random classes will be replaced by the deadlines of paying mortgages and other loans. A great way of minimizing those conflicts of interest is to try and live within my means. Ambition is a great motivator for continual self improvement so long as it doesn't turn into the desperate pursuit of an unsustainable way of life.",D4L

I believe that the long term success of their health will not be dictated by my treatment but by how they take care of themselves, in that regard I hope to be able to educate and empower my patients so that they develop the habits and knowledge for long term health. I plan on pursuing continuing education so that I can provide the highest quality of care when the surgical model is required, but I hope to have the greatest long term impact through education and motivation.",D4L

I'm still having trouble taking quality impressions and need to improve my technique.

Entry 10/5/2015: It's become pretty obvious to me that I sometimes struggle to give patients and faculty a clear and concise response about the questions they may have of me. I should really practice taking some time to gather my thoughts and think things through before responding. Most of the time I know the answers to their questions but get too blindsided to give a clear answer. I think people will understand if I respond with a ""let me think about that for a minute"" before tackling the issue.

I have been honing my hand skills for roughly two years and have noticed an amazing transition in my ability to work in the mouth. I will soon be seeing patients and will be granted the privilege to treat real patients. This is both an exciting and intimidating period for me but I feel confident in being able to identify and manage cases that I'm capable of handling and those that I know will be slightly outside of my scope. It motivates me to continue to improve both my hand skills and knowledge so that I can provide the best possible care to the patients who put their trust in my ability to treat them.

Over the past 4 years, ethics has played a large role every day of my clinical and pre-clinical work. While in class, we learn that ethics is a combination of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, confidentiality, and communication. This all comes into play when dealing with patients. It is important when creating treatment plans to remember the patient's chief complaint and provide them all of the information they need to make an informed decision. In addition, each patient has the right to their own confidentiality, so following the guidelines of HIPAA and beyond are critical. Non-maleficence is of course necessary, as it is the ultimate pillar of ethical practice. We are given a responsibility to care for the public, so it is important to handle this responsibility with care.",D4L

In order to do this, I should develop my professional confidence and competency as well as learn to be a leader among my coworkers.

9.16.15

These past couple of weeks have been quite a learning experience. I've been doing a few new treatment plans, several with dental complexities. In addition, I have made a few axium mistakes and learned (the hard way) a few new coding policies (continuation of comprehensive exam should always be treatment planned along with the initial comprehensive exam, the right way to treatment plan SRP and perio maintenance, the fact that you can leave notes for individual teeth in the axium odontogram, and that SRP may be indicated even if the probing depths are not over 5 mm). Here are some of the interesting cases I am currently working with:

David Ortiz- 44 y/o male, previous drug abuser, almost edentulous maxilla (4 non restorable teeth with gross decay)
 I started this case with Dr. Lee for a maxillary CD and mandibular RPD, and will now be working with Dr. Jyoshi. We will be making a couple of changes to the RPD, and will no longer need to do survey crowns. The patient is anxious to get the process moving, but can only come on Monday evenings 6-8 PM and couldn't make it the past two weeks.

Luis Mejia- 68 y/o male, high blood pressure controlled with medication
We are considering the ethical dilemma of doing what the patient wants- extract teeth that ARE restorable in favor of a partial denture instead of doing what would be ideally indicated dentally- crowns on all remaining teeth.

Linda Ziering-
Treatment plan in progress. The patient will have an edentulous space on the posterior upper right after treatment so it is interested to think of ways to help the patient maintain quality of life. She has an EXTREMELY strong gag reflex and it was my first time trying to take impressions on a patient with that strong of a gag reflex + a very high palate. She even gagged while taking bitewing xrays. 

Ateeb Hussein- 20 y/o male with high risk for caries
This patient has already had previous extractions and is congenitally missing one premolar from each quadrant. He has several (8) caries into the dentin and spots of demineralization. I strongly emphasized OHI to him and told him that if he changes his dental care habits, he can profoundly save his dental health, especially considering he is so young. I need to prescribe prevident to him at his next appointment as well. He now seems really committed, but probably needs continued encouragement and reinforcement. 

Marlene Browne- high blood pressure, female
Patient has an edentulous space on her mandibular ridge in the area of #30. She would like to consider getting an implant. She also needs a crown on one of her teeth with existing composite but very involved recurrent decay. It should be an interesting case because it will probably be the first crown I work on.

This week, I also worked on an emergency case where a patient came in with a fractured 6 unit temporary dental bridge (#6-11). It was a difficult treatment because fabricated a new temporary bridge doesn't yield any guaruntee that the new one would not crack as well. There just seemed to be too much flexion in the area of the anterior teeth , so the remaining abutment teeth, since the luxatemp matierial is so thin in these areas, cracked regardless. We reinforced the luxatemp material with bonding agent and composite to give it a little more strength and decrease the brittle factor. 

I also went to treatment planning this morning (on accident, because my actual session is apparently not until 9/30). It was a very interesting case though, and I think it reinforces my fascination with periodontistry. It's amazing to me how everything in our field really does depend on the soft tissue and bone surrounding teeth.

9.30.15
This past week has been a whirlwind. Two of my patients referred their friends to me, both who require extensive treatment plans. It was a little stressful because there were several issues with the xray machines almost everyday this week. I will be continuing the treatment planning tomorrow and next week, when hopefully the x ray units are functional again. 

I also experienced my first unpleasant patient interaction over the phone, as I was trying to schedule an appointment with a patient who had been transferred to me by the front desk. Even before meeting me, he requested to see a different student dentist because he preferred a competent male. Although this was a little disheartening at first, I don't take it personally anymore because this was something the patient believed regardless of anything I could do. 

This past week, I also completed 3 restorations and selective SRP on patients. Fortunately, everything went smoothly with all of these procedures. I am also reading up on crown and RPD procedures again, as I will be beginning these procedures in the upcoming weeks. It seems like there was a lot we didn't learn in pre-clinical courses because there are so many dental materials and techniques to be aware of.

10.7.15

Things I am learning about myself:
1) Multitasking is just NOT my forte. I feel like a deer in headlights anytime I have to, because I really need to focus on one thing at a time to do anything effectively. I'm going to try to keep this in mind when I'm preparing for clinic as well.
2) I think I'm really good at the ""assistant"" role, in most circumstances. I've worked a variety of jobs for the past 8 years, since I was 16, and they have all been assistant-type roles. I think this helped me in my work ethic, being able to better deal with different people and personalities, and be able to work in new settings. However, I think it has become part of my nature now, as I am more comfortable being a sidekick, or assistant, or a supporter than to have to be a leader or in the spotlight. I think it might be time to step outside of my comfort zone and try to be more of a leader, because I will need to at least appear as one to be taken 100% seriously.

Every Thursday without skipping a beat, Dr. Polikoff asks ""why are you always so happy?"" in disbelief as he walks past my cubicle. And like a reflex, I always respond ""I'm living the dream"". Honestly, it really is true. This is the dream, every bit of it, from getting [almost] barfed on taking alginate impressions to later getting reprosil stuck throughout a patient's mustache. I'm thankful for the laughs, the craziness, the patients, and most of all, the unity that we have as a clinic that lets us share our triumphs and frustrations with each other. 

In the spirit of Thanksgiving, my absolute favorite holiday, I thought I would write a little about an article I read recently in the NY times. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/choose-to-be-grateful-it-will-make-you-happier.html?_r=1

It describes how you can actually become happier by forcing yourself to think of all the things you are thankful for. For a few years now as part of my morning routine, I make my cup of coffee and think of all of my blessings in life. It helps me carry a lot of positive energy with me throughout my day. It really helps me get through the times where I make mistakes, deal with tough situations, and witness negativity that is outside my control. Of all the things on Earth that we have little control over, I think it is nice to take charge of the things that are within our reach such as our attitudes, punctuality, and spreading good vibes. I hear from a lot of professionals that I'm still in the beginning and that I will inevitably become more jaded with time. I'm not sure about that, but I hope to hold on to my gratitude for as long as I possibly can.

SORRY!! Yes, it has been FIVE weeks since I have updated this beast. Despite this, I think the past 5 weeks have been the most stagnant in terms of the learning curve in clinic. The last few weeks of December, I switched my focus from living and breathing clinic, to trying to pass finals. I also began my pediatric rotation on Thursdays, and it helped me realize that I think pediatric dentistry is absolutely not for me (at least for now). I love working with kids in a variety of settings, but dentistry is just not one of them. It was heartbreaking to see how tormented several of the children were to be in a dental office. I even spoke with some of the faculty who are recent graduates, and their surprisingly bleak view of their day to day professional life did not do much to change my perspective. I think this completes me looking into all the specialties, except endo, and so I feel good about my interest in pursuing general dentistry as my career.

At our recent Dean's New Year Party, I was huddled in the clique known as the rhinos, and we were listening to Dr. Soeprono talk about how in your thirties, everything settles down and life really starts to come together. At the time, I, perhaps appearing a little cocky, responded that I feel like I'm already there. Thinking about it later, I can't say I've changed my mind. Not to say I have it all together (LOL, if only you knew), but I feel like life has really been coming together these past few months in clinic. Perhaps it's because school is much more streamlined and consistent compared to the hectic mess of a schedule I once knew as my life, but I just feel very strongly that this is where I'm meant to be.

What really is success? Is it the dentist that makes the most money? Is it the dentist that is the most loved? Is it the dentist who strikes the perfect work-life balance? I've been thinking a lot about what success really is lately, and what my goals should be in order to be a successful dentist. I think so far, I've concluded that success is ever changing. More about the journey than the destination, I think it's a concept that we are all chasing to help us be the best version of ourselves. Maybe immediately after I graduate, I will define success as being able to pay off my loan or start a practice. Maybe later in my career, it will be more about the work-life balance. Maybe a little later, it will be about trying to ward off ""dentist's hunchback"". Who knows?

On another note, I had oral surgery rotation last week and it ended up actually being...pretty cool. The faculty were pretty nice and understanding, for surgeons that is. I liked that it was fast paced, putting people out of pain, and not about being pretty per se. There was just something about getting down and dirty with relatively caveman instruments to literally just remove a problem that was strangely satisfying. I also got to assist with some interesting implant and sedation cases with the residents. During the week, several faculty and residents were saying I should consider going into surgery, because they thought I was a ""natural"". At the time, I was pretty flattered, and was like ""oh gosh, who ME?!""[acts coy and humble].  Later, when I thought about what they must have seen to make them think that, I think it really just boils down to who they liked working with in the operating rooms. I watched other students assist and saw some who were just completely zoned out, some who were MAJORLY sucking up, and some who were chatterboxes. I definitely made my best attempt to be helpful, less socially awkward [don't know if I succeeded at that one], but stay out of the way when things get serious. This teamwork is probably all it takes to be a ""natural"" in that sort of setting, considering most of the surgeries I watched were more of a team effort. So sadly, no, I'm not special and I'm not naturally gifted with supernatural surgeon hands. But I will take it as reassurance that my attempts at being socially not obnoxious were well received that day.

Clinic has been picking up lately. I recently got a few new patients who were referred from other patients so it's nice to know that some people trust me with their friends and family. I'm also working on my denture cases now, which is a steep learning curve. I'm almost resigned to thinking that the only way to learn how to do something right with dentures is to mess it up at least once first. Even when I read up from the old CR2 manual, it is so different doing VDO/VDR, bite registration, etc on a real person.

Clinic- So I haven't been having very good luck with endo lately. I've started 5 molar endos and have completed...NONE. I still have hope for two of them, but after several appointments spent on 3 of the maxillary first molar endos and then having to resort to referring to the endodontists, my optimism is a little reserved. I think I like what I've been able to do so far with it, but I don't like all of the guesswork involved with possibly missing an MB2, an extra root, not knowing if your working lengths are really and truly accurate, etc. Thank goodness I haven't had any new patient appointments this past week (only saw my regulars), because it was pretty hard to have my usual energy being sick.

Extracurricular- I'm excited to go to the National Oral Health Conference April 18th-20th :) It has been a while since I've been to an academic conference, but from what I remember, they are pretty good at motivating you about whatever the theme is.

Other- I finally have had some time this week to get organized again, because I got a little behind since spring break and being sick for the past week. As much as I love time off from school, it definitely makes me anxious when I come back because I feel like I forgot how to ""adult"".

My apologies for slacking heavily on my e-portfolio responsibilities. Overall, clinic has been great. I really enjoy that D3's are in clinic now, because I can recognize how far I've come over the past year when I can help some of them with little tips that I stumbled across this past year. I feel much more comfortable with the ""bread and butter"" of general dentistry, such as SRP, composite restorations, endo, crowns, and troubleshooting a few of the ""exceptions"". There is still a lot left to learn, but I am more confident in my work and can identify my areas of weakness better. Since I'm planning on working in general dentistry when I graduate, I've been trying to push myself more this year, slightly outside my comfort zone, to do things more independently, more accurately, and more efficiently. I want to continue to learn how to manage more complex situations in dentistry, for when things don't go exactly as planned, but I think this will come with time.

On other news, the job search has left me more confused about what I want to do than I was last year. Also, I like doing [straightforward] endo now.

It's WREB weekend for me, so here I am in GA studying for it. Clinic has been going well. I was in hospital oral surgery rotation which was a fun break from my usual clinic routine, but I'm glad to be back. On the rotation, I saw two cases SCCA in real life, so I'm glad I have a better idea of what it looks like in different people so I will know when to biopsy it. I also saw them do a punch biopsy for it, so I have a better understanding of how that works. One of the patients didn't have any of the usual risk factors for cancer (no smoking, no drinking, no family history of cancer, etc), but she had an ill fitting denture for the past 20+ years that caused her to bite her tongue repeatedly. The attending surgeon said that sometimes chronic inflammation resulting from trauma can actually cause cancer, so it is good to know there can be pretty serious consequences to fabricating ill fitting dentures, so it is important to take your time doing each step for dentures accurately.

The past few weeks in clinic have been busy screening patients to see if they may qualify to participate in the NERB exam. As I'm going through this process, a few things became more clear to me. One is that patient satisfaction and rapport are VERY important. If I think to put myself in a patient's shoes, to come in to the clinic at 7 AM on a weekend to participate in this does not seem like something I may want to do. We needs to be cognizant of what our patient's experience during their time here, as it's a reflection on ourselves. In addition, it also seems that this test  is mostly stressful because of the factors outside of our control. In dentistry, we as practitioners have control over several factors during procedures. In real life though, there are several things that we cannot foresee or address. Remembering this going into practice next year will be important.

Ninety five days from our official graduation date, I feel nervous yet excited, but prepared. The past two years in clinic, I feel that I have had a wide variety of dental experiences and have a strong foundation for the lifelong learning that is to come. Though I am still waiting to do a bridge and restore implants over the next couple of months, I've completed most of our required procedures. However, I feel that most of my learning came from the unexpected experiences and the unexpected procedures that needed to be innovated or addressed in moments of acute managements. In addition, I feel more comfortble with making the right clinical decisions independently if needed and knowing when a procedure is outside my scope. With the rigorous workload at NYU, I'm nervous about the typical D4 worries such as finding the perfect job, but I'm not worried about being able to face future challenges that I may face related to dentistry.",D4L

Clinic really hastens the process of becoming a professional. There are various aspects of professionalism that we are required to balance and tailor to our own personalities.

Professionalism encompasses several factors. From observing the faculty and mentors at the school, I find that professionalism can come in unexpected ways, the ways that are not taught in a textbook. For example, for patients to respect and be loyal to dental practitioners, it is important to gain trust. While this can happen partially from being ethical, this is expected. It is going above and beyond, by showing that you care for your patients, being available to address their concerns, standing behind the quality of work, and helping the patient address their chief complaint. In addition, it is important to be professional and reliable with your colleagues and coworkers. These are the people whose opinion of your professionalism can make a profound difference in your reputation in your community.",D4L

Over the course of the past few months, I've learned that MANY things encompass what makes one develop into a professional. I find that the greatest learning comes from the little things. For example, when you are running late completing a procedure, but the next patient has already arrived for an appointment, you need to be a professional and be able to notify the patient who has arrived but also stay calm and complete the task at hand. In addition, being a dental professional depends heavily on timeliness and preparedness. If you know exactly what to do in a procedure and have all of the supplies necessary in an organized set up, this can help one become much more efficient and be able to maintain professionalism through punctuality.

Two years into clinic, I feel confident several of the skills that I was initially unsure about. I still remember starting clinic and being a little unsure when I detected caries around a crown margin, or detecting the extent of caries for a restoration. Now, I feel very confident in identifying caries, arrested caries, etc. In addition, I feel more confident in the gray-area aspects of dentistry such as addressing a patient's sensitivity and how to treat it. For example, there are different theories in addressing possible dentin hypersensitivity from using a desensitizing resin vs. restoring with composite. Or perhaps, in monitoring a patient who has potential vertical root fracture. I feel that I have a better understanding of using these techniques in continuity of patient care and management.",D4L

Between learning axium, learning the proper protocols for treatment planning, and learning about the various new dental materials available in clinic, I feel like I am learning a course's worth of information in each clinic session. I truly enjoy this part of my dental school experience the most, as I am fully engaged in speaking with patients and trying to tailor treatment plans to best suit each patient's needs. I've also had the opportunity to learn various techniques from watching faculty members mentoring other students. I hope these observations will help me perform procedures smoothly when I come across them in my own patient population.

By always acting in a professional manner we uphold our reputation as competent and well-rounded individuals. Taking part in a few outreaches this year has shown me that people really value this profession. Having my first patient really helped me understand how to conduct in a professional manner. But having multiple patients has helped me learn how to speak to patients and what information they need to know upfront, compared to things that can be explained in future appointments.

It  was so easy to work on typodont in CR2; however, it took me 2 sessions to border mold and the patient was upset about it.
Now, my main focus is to gain as much experience as possible in order to deliver the best care to the patients. Also, knowing how to work with different faculties is important.

Doing the procedures on the typodont teeth is completely different from doing it on real patients. And most of the time I forgot what I learned from the lecture and couldn't apply it in the clinic. I will enhance myself, review and familiarize those skills and principles when I have more clinical exposure.

It's not like they can grow another set of teeth! I would try to convince them to save money and go for the ideal treatments. However, now I realize one very important skill is being able to meet the patient where they are. Letting people know what you're seeing and explaining what you can do for them is our duty.

70,UTi5JIjz,Private Personal,15-02-17 13:45,13.75,"When I was accepted to the New York University College of Dentistry, it was the realization of my lifelong dream and the culmination of nearly a decade and a half. Excited, slightly nervous, but determined, I was swept up in the dental school experience. I didn't know it then, but a single presentation would alter the trajectory of my education for years to come. Dr. Brian Schmidt's presentation on head and neck cancer struck me like a bolt of lightning: I am not ashamed to say that whatever I had thought of dentistry, it had not been this. I was invigorated; I had never anticipated I would find a home so quickly or utterly -- it was the spark that ignited a whole world of possibilities.
Galvanized by Dr. Schmidt's presentation and work, I set out to learn everything I could about earning my way into the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program. I soon understood that a dentist's and a surgeon's education is never done, but that prospect only deepened my resolve. Even though class is vital, especially for a strong foundation of science and procedure, I was increasingly of the mind that: If I wanted to be a surgeon, there were other skills I had to obtain outside of the classroom. I had to get as close to oral surgery as I could get, to see the classroom material fleshed out in reality. Participating in externships, and many trips to Bellevue Hospital later, I am finding myself increasingly unable to pass up an opportunity to be in the OR.
Meanwhile, I was becoming increasingly aware of my passion and willingness to share knowledge. Together with like-minded students, I was a founding member of Scio Society in 2013, which was created to provide an enriched learning environment to enhance the academic performance and professional success of our peers. Fast on the heels of the Scio Society were other rewarding experiences: Organizing weekly tutoring sessions catered to first year dental students in Dr. Baker's Head and Neck Anatomy course, helping third year dental students prepare for their NBDE Part I exam, as well as a Selective in Teaching Skills to help first year students excel as quickly as possible in their laboratory work; I had found something that competed for my time with surgery: The love of learning and then sharing that knowledge with others. As the OMS Journal Club Co-ordinator for the OMS Society, I could share fascinating journal articles related to oral surgery with my fellow students, and also help to foster relationships with OMS faculty and residents.
At the Dean's Awards in May 2016, I was delighted and humbled as a third year dental student to be awarded the Pierre Fauchard Academy Scholarship, traditionally given to one fourth year student who demonstrates the greatest potential for development into an outstanding leader in the dental profession. And shortly after that, I was privileged to be granted entry into New York University's highly competitive and respected Oral Surgery Honors Program. I was well on my way to the goal I set for myself in the first semester of my first year, only this time I am able to reflect on what my time at New York University College of Dentistry has meant to me, and how far I have come -- and still have to go.
My journey to NYU began in the sweltering yard of an orphanage for children with HIV/AIDS in India. Under that merciless sun, in my own small way, I was able to bring some brief solace to children who faced an uncertain future in a developing country with not much to offer in the way of healthcare. Beyond games, laughter, and some simple kindness, I was powerless to do anything to help them. I had joined the Projects Abroad, Medicine in India Project, to gain more experience to bolster my admissions qualifications for dental school, but did not realize that I would be bolstered in another way -- utterly unrelated to admissions, it was nevertheless an epiphany of sorts: The experience freed me from a singularly idealized and merely academic understanding of my chosen discipline, by reinjecting the vital dimension: Human connection.
And it was watching my mom fight and live with cancer, all the while remaining the same wonderful, loving person, generous with a smile and enduringly supportive, that furthered my understanding and respect for the person behind the patient. Endless visits to oncologists, chemotherapy sessions, and the constant exhaustion, were not enough to dull her quiet and calm strength and fighting spirit that continue to inspire me to this day.
I have now been on both sides of healthcare. I've felt powerless, scared, resigned and shaken to my core; and also been able, thanks to my learning and training as a dentist to help ease the suffering of people in my care. I can be better at the latter because I remember the former. It was during my time as a dental student that I observed firsthand that surgeons don't jettison their caring, compassion, kindness or empathy, they harness them.",D4L

As mentioned in previous statement, many students and faculty at NYU do not follow the guidelines of ethical principles, creating a confusion when I reflect and differentiate between what's considered ethical.  For example, students often aim to finish their requirements without considering for the patient first.  In addition, ethical principles are parallel to a degree with moral principles that are violated as well.  I'm beginning to learn that these principles are translated differently among individuals, but this has also taught me to take importance of these principles.

We won't just be titled as dentists in dental office, but society will see us as healthcare professionals so we must act the part.  Healthcare professionals often demands respect from patients without showing any respectable behaviors, but I believe as professionals, we must respect the patients before expecting the same in return.

I'm not saying that this will lead to a decline in quality/level of service you'll provide, or that you'll end up engaging in unethical behavior, but it certainly is a slippery slope.  It has become a constant lightbulb going off in my head that I want to try and avoid having that ever happen to me.

D2 - I've been heavily involved with research still. Although I don't have plans of pursuing a specialty just yet, I may want to consider a career in academia and I think the research experience will help. I may want to pursue a PhD in the future along with a certificate in Orthodontics but my grades are not where they need to be for me to achieve something like that so I'll need to work on improving my grades more.

D4 - As I near the end of my dental school education, I feel NYU has provided me with the sufficient didactic and clinical knowledge to move on to the next stage of my career. At this point, I will most likely not be choosing to specialize as I enjoy the diversity of knowledge and practice in general dentistry.

That may sometimes mean dealing with people who are rude to you and disrespect you.  All personal differences and feelings must be put aside and you must instead focus on their best interest even when it doesn't align with yours.

It was interesting how many of us act a certain way when we're with friends and colleagues but completely different when we're in front of patients. In a way though, it's necessary, as when you're with a patient, you're expected to be not just a student, but a care provider. I can see that a lot of us have matured, myself included. As we're spending more time in clinic, we've begun carrying ourselves differently and we're more aware of those around us.

Now that we're ending our dental school career, I've seen many of us mature a lot. Not only did we all physically get older, our attitudes and how we conduct ourselves amongst peers, faculty, and patients have all somewhat changed.

It involves your commitment to the profession and your wanting to see it better tomorrow than it was today.  Overall, I feel that becoming a professional means being able to uphold the values and expectations put forth on you by your peers and colleagues as well as the rest of society.

Now that we're rising D3's, I feel we've gotten a much better grasp on being a dental professional. When you're with a patient, you have to be conscientious of the fact that they're relying on you to do the best you can for them. Knowing that, you tend to try twice as hard to really stay on top of everything and be a true professional.

As D4's, I feel we've come far in terms of our confidence and our abilities to be valuable health providers in the dental profession.

I feel like I've learned and experienced a lot and that I have many ideas to share with people who are wondering if this is something for them. I didn't come from a traditional path and thus took a significantly longer route to get to where I am today. Research takes a lot of my time as well but I find it rewarding enough that I can't see myself giving it up.

D3 is going to be my last opportunity to really get my academic grades up to par. I learned how to study a bit better and was able to do better than D1 but I was still far from my goals GPA-wise.

After going to the lectures and listening to what Dr. Moore had to say, it became clear that we all had so much to learn with ethics.

From what I've seen over the last four years are people who think they know what to do but actually don't. I think this is the most dangerous. I will always try to know my limits and only practice within them.

Ethics and morality are often intertwined but each map a different aspect of ones self. Ethics is not up for debate (there is often moral grey area) as it is determined by a set of cultural values/beliefs. That culture was set by the dentists and other dental professionals before me. I must work to uphold those ethical values and to embody them at all times. I first owe my undivided attention to my patients' well-being and will do whatever necessary to promote that.

I will always try my best to make people feel comfortable and leave happier than when they came.

I believe that my time at NYUCD has not only been to teach me dental techniques and procedures, but more so to teach me how to be a professional. I have learned how to act as a doctor should in certain situations and to respond accordingly to different types of patients. I know this is a never ending process and that it will only intensify once in the work place.

I will try my best to act in accordance with my own moral and ethical values and to promote them within my community.

As dentists we are expected to be able to perform various procedures like fixing patient's cavities, relieving their dental pain, and fixing their aesthetic concerns. One of the most important aspects of dentistry that most patient's fail to consider is ethics. Is the dentist abiding by the laws with regard to cleanliness? Are they making the proper referrals when receiving cases they are not qualified to handle? Are they performing the procedures to an acceptable standard? These are all goals that I strive to improve upon each and every day. It concerns me to find that not all people care about their patients equally.

Using four handed dentistry with classmates, or D2s that are assisting, requires more than just asking the other person what you need; it's important to be able to communicate so well that the other person is predicting the move of the clinician. Additionally, I have been rotating through the Nurse Practitioner clinic which is an inter-professional program, that brings together myself and a NP student and we do a physical of the patient together, I show the NP student and report my findings of the head and neck exam, and the student does the same with regards to full physical.
