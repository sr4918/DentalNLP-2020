I have been around the dental field for the past few years, working in a dental office as a dental assistant.  I want to transition from being a dental assistant to a dentist.  I hope once I finish my four years at NYU I will be a confident and ethical doctor.  I find it so important to establish trusting relationship with patients, and the first thing is to do everything in the best interest of the patient.",D1F
2,Q2a1zJef,Private Self Reflection,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"Becoming a professional I believe takes time.

3,Q3KOrarY,Ethic Reflection,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"As a health care professional, it is my duty to be ethical in all my actions and interactions. In treating patients, I will learn about the community around me so that I can be culturally sensitive and empathetic. I will also stick to a code of ethics that I will hold myself to. These will include putting my patient's desires, and health and oral health above my own personal desires. I will always provide my patients with all their options so that they may be able to make the best decision for their oral health based on their limitations and their understanding. I will always document my procedures and any important events that occur during my patient's visit, so that I can legally protect myself and themselves, and so that the work is documented for future review.",D1F
4,Q3KOrarY,Private Personal,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"As a dental student, I will strive to learn about various oral health diseases and their symptoms, as well as different methods to improve oral hygiene. I will also learn the processes behind these diseases, and how to treat them. In the clinic, I will learn about the characteristics of each teeth, how to restore them via crowns, fillings, or root canals, how to remove caries, and how to create models and impressions for studying a patient's mouth or for preparing crowns or retainers. I will also learn how to interact with patients in terms of explaining procedures to them in words they can understand, in a manner that is respectful, and in a empathetic and ethical way (putting the patient's health and wants above my own personal desires). Finally, I hope to learn from my colleagues and practice communicating and working together with them.",D1F

However I will not limit myself to these specialties and I will explore other areas of specialty. I will also be satisfied with being a general dentist as well. Ultimately though, it depends on what I find I enjoy the most. I would also like to open my own clinic or at least have a clinic with another associate, especially because of the ease of accessibility to another dentist's opinion. Finally, I will strive to treat all my patients with respect, and all my colleagues with gratification and respect.",D1F
6,Q3KOrarY,Public Self Reflection,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"In becoming a health professional, I hope to provide my patients with the best care I can possibly give. That includes continuing my education by going to conventions and conferences to learn about the most up to date technologies for oral hygiene. I will also constantly challenge myself to better my work, by self-assessing myself often and checking on past work to see if anything should be redone. As a professional, I will strive for clear and concise communication with the patient and with my colleagues. I will also attempt to ensure that all my patients understand the importance of oral hygiene to overall health and the various ways they can take care of their teeth and health.",D1F
7,Q3KOrarY,Professional Progress,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"In my journey towards being a professional, I have learned how to interact with my peers and collaborate on work together. I have also learned how to study and help others when it comes to didactic and clinical work. I have recognized the importance of clear communication with peers to ensure understanding. I have also learned the importance of keeping the patient informed about their treatment. As I continue, I will learn how to speak to my patients in a professional and respectable manner. I will also learn how to communicate with my colleagues in a respectable and professional manner, especially over disagreements.",D1F
8,Q3KOrarY,Public Personal,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"As a dental student, I will strive to learn how to best serve my patients, the community around me, and various communities around the country and the world. Specifically, I will become knowledgeable on the causes and symptoms of dental diseases as well as full body diseases, especially those that can become evident in the oral cavity. I will learn to treat patients both in the short-term and long-term capacity. I will also strive to treat all my patients with respect, sympathy, and ethically. I will always put the patient's health and desires above any personal gain, and I will be sure to refer my patient's to other doctors or dentists if I do not feel able to complete a procedure.",D1F

Maintaining high ethical and moral standards has been one of the most important philosophical aspects of my life. Becoming a dental professional will allow me to apply my philosophy to be able to help treat patients and contribute to society. I will ask as many questions as possible that I have throughout my educational career at NYUCD to professors and peers, and utilize the school resources for progress in my dental career.",D1F
13,Q3wmSU0o,Professional Progress,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"The orientation was long, but it already taught me many things about dental school.

My goal is to make professional and personal contacts within NYUCD and in NYC. I would like to spend time studying the basic sciences and thoroughly learn general dentistry skills in the clinic, at the same time enjoying the materials. In doing so, I intend to get involved in many outreach trips and school-related clubs, in particular the Korean Student organization and ADEA. I would like to become close friends with people from my group and other classmates whom I will get to meet. In my D3 and D4 years, I am interested in participating elective and Honors programs because even if I become a GP, I want to be knowledgeable about systemic oral disease detections. I would like to be a helpful member of the NYUCD community and reach our professional goals as a whole.",D1F

There are several factors that make a dentist a good professional but I believe one of the most important things for a professional is to be independent and proficient in their job. In other words, professionals should be consistent and punctual. In addition, it is important to follow the rules and regulation to prevent reckless and nefarious malpractices. However, this does not mean that one should be stagnant and passive in their profession. Rather, I believe it is important for professional to actively seek out for improvements and advancements. This can be achieved through working, discussing and researching issues with different professionals in various different fields in the profession. Moreover, it is important for professionals to have appropriate moral and ethical standards. I believe these are some of the factors that are crucial in becoming a good professional.",D1F
16,QRWhtutU,Public Personal,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"Ever since I realized that dentistry is one of the few professions that seamlessly blend both artistry and science, I was fascinated by it. It is, thus natural, that I have vast interest in becoming an orthodontist. However, I would like to be exposed to a various different dental specialties not only through school curriculum but also through community outreach and volunteer service. As a dental student, I would like to graduate dental school in good standing with proficiency in general dentistry. As a health care professional, I would like to learn not only the technical skills but also the interpersonal skills to have fulfilling relationships with various different patients. I realize this skill would require me to uphold my ethical principles as well as the rules and regulation at all times. Moreover, I hope that I would be more open-minded and bold in making decisions. In addition, I would like to have a good lifelong relationship with my peers in both private and professional environment.",D1F

I believe that as a healthcare professional, we have a duty to provide our patients with the most effective treatment and when we know we are not the right person for our patient to not hesitate and relay our patient to the right person. 

While in dental school I want to always put forth an honest effort in my work and not take any shortcuts because I want to make sure I really understand what is being taught as my future patients deserve that kind of honest effort from their dentist. Also I want to contribute to an honest learning environment and reach out to any peers that I may see struggling.",D1F

20,QRWhtutX,Public Self Reflection,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"I believe in order to become a professional in the field of dentistry, you must go beyond knowing just the craft of dentistry. It also means how you present yourself and how you treat the people you are working with. For instance punctuality and respect are two important aspects that patients look for in a dentist aside from his/her technical abilities. A dentist that is unorganized or difficult to make appointments with is hard for the patient to trust in putting their oral health in. Also even though the dentist is the head of his/her practice, it takes a cohesive and supportive team of individuals to treat the dental patient properly. Thus, a dentist that does not present him/herself to the dental team in a professional manner will never gain their trust.",D1F
21,QRWhtutX,Professional Progress,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,At this point I am not entirely certain where I want to practice dentistry. I do know that if I feel that I am not ready once I graduate from dental school I will immediately look to do some residency to get myself to the level of competency I am comfortable to practice solo. I do want to eventually have my own dental practice and after some time try to expand.,D1F
22,QRWhtutX,Public Personal,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"I hope to become competent enough that when I graduate my friends will fully trust me to perform dentistry on them if need be. I hope to at least maintain the passion I had for this field when I walked to my first class this year and hopefully expand that passion when I graduate. I want to work  hard and to always be humble of the fact that I should never be satisfied with my level of competence in dentistry. As long as I keep learning I know I will be more competent than yesterday but not as competent as I can be tomorrow. Areas that I need to work on is to be less stubborn and more open minded, and I need to be organized with my clinics and lab from the get go to not get messy habits.",D1F

My family dentist is a man who I feel is a very ethical person, who always does the right thing and puts the needs of his patients first.  While I have heard stories about other dentists refusing to see a certain type of patient, my family dentist always has an open door.  He believes that his job wasnt to make as much money as possible, but to service others and give back to his community.  As a future dentist this is how I want to run my practice.  I want to be known as the dentist who will see everyone, no matter what his or her situation may be.  I feel that to be a great dentist, you have to be a great person first and foremost.  You have to admit and correct your mistakes.  Above all, you have to truly care about your work and your patients.  You have to WANT to make a difference in someones life.",D1F

I have never been the one to seek appraisal, but I want to be known as a great dentist, someone who listens to and actually cares about his patients.  I have no idea where I would like to practice, but I am leaning more towards going back home to Niagara-on-the-Lake.  I do however feel guilty about pursuing a career in dentistry, as my family back home owns a couple of vineyards, and there is always lots of work to do.  However, now my dad has to bear the brunt of the work by himself.  While I do know that he is proud of what Ive accomplished, I would like to go back home when I graduate and help my parents out as much, if not more, than they have helped me.  I am leaning towards working 3-4 days a week at my practice, and possible 2-3 days helping out on the farm.  I feel like that would be the ideal situation.",D1F

I have always wanted to become a dentist and work in the health-care profession because I truly like helping people; especially making people smile and happy.  However, I have noticed that a lot of people I know would say to me,  you are going to make so much money,  but to be honest I do not care about money.  To me, dentistry would be the perfect lifestyle and not a job/work.  How can it be work if you get to do what you love and are interested in everyday?  I get to interact with my patients and be there for them, whether it be dental related or otherwise.  I want to be known as the ""people's dentist"", where everyone knows my name and knows that my door is open to everyone.

While they can cause considerable pain and discomfort, teeth can also bring joy and happiness.  I have always believed that dentists treat much more than just patients teeth.  A dentist has the capability to improve a persons life through their smile.  A dentist can improve how a person views themselves and possibly how others view them.  My desire has always been to become a dentist so that I can make a difference in my patients lives, no matter how big or small.  As a future health care professional, I believe that everyone should be entitled to dental care.  I am looking forward to giving back to communities, both locally and abroad, through the various outreach programs that NYUCD offers.  However, to be able to successfully and efficiently provide dental care, I must first gain the knowledge and skills that are required to provide patients with the best possible treatment.

I know that sounds kind of vague, and I haven't found a better way to express that just yet, but what I mean is to fix whatever facial deformities or defects that are present. My pre-dental society in undergrad would have dental health professionals speak every week and I remember one in particular where he should photos of people that had to wear facial prosthetics to cover what were essentially parts of their face or jaw missing. At the time I thought the very fact a prosthodontist could make something and give it to the patient to wear was amazing. But what I really want to do is go one step beyond that and make wearing the prosthetic unnecessary. Facial reconstruction is I think the coolest thing. From what I know I think leans heavily toward OMS and bigger hospital surgeries which I rather prefer than private practice. When we talk about improving quality of life, I believe there is no greater way to increase that than down this path.",D1F
32,UMXIJMd9,Public Self Reflection,9/28/2013 11:21,11.35,"In undergrad, I was a Human Biology major, but I also minored in Philosophy. One particular article sticks out in my mind whenever I think of professionalism and what it means. The article talked about ""civic professionalism"" and how there is an inherent contract, or trust, between the public and the professional. And moreover, we as professionals should give back to the community for without the community providing patients how would we have learned our craft. I think that as I progress throughout dental school this will become more relevant and I know whatever opportunity I have to give back or do a community outreach I will try my best to make it happen. What's the point of having these skills if we don't try to use them to promote the greatest degree of quality life we can.",D1F

I've worked with dental professionals from around the United States, Mexico, and Australia and have a strong sense of what I want to get out of dentistry -- I simply want to be able to fix people's faces. To me,  a person's face is their most important feature giving them the self-confidence to go out and interact with the world. Now what path this aim of mine takes me down from here on out I don't know, but what I do know is that throughout all the pitfalls I've overcome I will not lose sight of my goal.

It is a very flexible profession that allows me to pursue other dental related interests outside of working in a group or office. Some of my future goals in dentistry include volunteering for programs that help underserved communities in the U.S and poverty-stricken areas throughout the world where dental care is not readily available. New York University College of Dentistry is in one of the best schools to facilitate my goals because it has many programs that serve the underserved communities. Furthermore, NYUCD has a diverse patient population, which allows me to interact with people of all different socioeconomic backgrounds.

I am interested in going into pediatric dentistry, so I will have to try really hard to get where I want to be.

Sometimes, ethics can mean working in a place that is in a sort of gray area that is neither black nor white. This requires one to cultivate a state of mind that provides good judgment, balance, and equilibrium between right and wrong, right and more right, and sometimes the lesser of two evils. The goal of being ethically aware is to act accordingly and appropriately.

The most obvious example of ethics in dentistry is to know when to refer out because of one's limitations and weaknesses in doing certain procedures. This is a balance act since ego can sometimes delude one to have a false sense of confidence, which could further result with clinical disasters and possible law suits. On the other hand, practicing dentistry means to venture slightly out of one's comfort zone in order to grow clinically and to become a better dentist. While the risks and rewards of practicing dentistry must be assessed, it is important to keep the patient's best interest as a top priority.",D1F

So I must reinvent myself to become a sophisticated man of class while remembering not to be too uptight and stuck up. Although I am truly proud of my academic achievements and admissions into dental school, I must remain humble and remember that I am blessed to have the opportunity to grow in the city of New York.

48,Wu21fbSx,Public Self Reflection,28-09-13 11:21,11.35,"Like others working in the health care field, dentists must adhere to the standards of being a doctor on and off ""the court."" I believe that professionalism sets its roots in the early-phase training of doctors, in the classroom and amongst one's peers, long before a dentist or other health care practitioner can begin to practice in the real world. How one behaves during the beginning phases set precedent for how he/she will behave later in live, both mentally for the individual as well as in the eyes of those with whom he comes to work. Undoubtedly, the moment we become doctors and part of a bigger community, we must follow strict guidelines as to how to behave in society. Thus, when one dentist/doctor acts dishonestly or in bad taste, we as health care professionals all feel the repercussions on one's wrong doing. This is why set guidelines are in effect and accordingly, why those who regard  themselves as doctors should hold to those very standards.",D1F

I would hold numerous recruitment events on and off campus, screen interviewees, and create a recruitment plan to be used by my successor. While I would be primarily responsible for my duties in this position, I realized more positive results would be attained by creating a diverse recruitment team to collaborate with, and this proved true.

Sometimes I am a little intimidated of this word, just because I would not want to claim being a professional without being certain that I possess all the characteristics of the word. It amazes me how much society values professionals and look at them with such respect.

I am the only one of my siblings to go to a professional school. If they were alive, I think that my parents would be very proud and maybe a little surprised that I chose dentistry. I feel like I am paving my own path. Being at NYUCD is both a tremendous honor and a great responsibility.",D1F

Given the importance of doctor-patient trust, getting specific training on how to maintain and uphold professional standards is in important part of the curriculum.",D1F

I take care when conversing with colleagues and instructors. A big part of professional development will come later--when patients are introduced into the equation. That said, it is exciting to feel more like a professional as I develop and work toward competencies in other areas.",D1F
