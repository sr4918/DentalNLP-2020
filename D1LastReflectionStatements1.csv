Communication is definitely important in terms of speaking with your colleagues and patients. I have also learned how to prepare and restore certain ideal preparations on plastic teeth in mannequin typodonts. I have become competent in performing these procedures and look forward to learning more complex procedures as well as working on real life patients. I have also learned about the anatomy of the entire body, specifically focused on the head and neck, as well as how various systems interact with each other. In this way, I am better prepared to work on patients, knowing what to avoid and any possible side effects that can occur with certain anesthesia.",D1L

I want to work  hard and to always be humble of the fact that I should never be satisfied with my level of competence in dentistry. As long as I keep learning I know I will be more competent than yesterday but not as competent as I can be tomorrow. Areas that I need to work on is to be less stubborn, to be more open minded, and I need to be organized with my clinics and lab from the get go to not get messy habits.

When I came to NYUCD I thought that I had a basic understanding of what dentistry entailed, but I quickly came to realize that my understanding was only at the tip of the iceberg.  I remember the first time I picked up a drill and had to carve out patterns in the stone panels and how poorly I controlled the drill; it was definitely a lot harder than it first appeared to be.  Over the course of the D1 year, I feel that I have significantly improved my drilling abilities, and have also cut down on the amount of time it takes me to complete an assignment.  The knowledge that I gained from my first year will definitely be a building block for my future courses and hopefully will stick with me as I wait to take the NBDE I in August 2015.",D1L

Some people just want to get by, and some people wants to shoot for OMFS/Ortho. What I realize throughout the year was that NYUCD tests you on ""how to take the test"" instead of the class material. Many time, the material that were tested on the test were never covered by the professors and they were just reused questions from the quiz bank, perhaps developed by previous professors. Thus, in order to be the top of the class, you need to you have those past exams. Inevitably, students will find their way to get to those past exams and this was considered cheating.

In turn, this has given me the opportunity to be part of exciting new groups and clubs which is really rewarding. Furthermore, for me the meaning of professionalism has certainly evolved.

By not learning and getting your way through school doing the bare minimum and relying on others to help you do what is your homework, you are going to reach the clinic in third year lacking a lot of skills that your colleagues will have. Of course many people have many different views on what is ethical and what is not, but there are some universal commonalities that everyone in the right state of mind will define as ethical vs unethical. Cheating on tests for example is very unethical. Lying to your patients for your personal benefit is very unethical as well.

In the profession of dentistry, being professional means you have to approach your problems in a way that is patient centred; they are the priority. It also means that you should be able to apply what you learn in lectures and pre clinic and apply it in the clinic. Being a professional also means being a leader.

17,WK+x3vce,Ethic Reflection,18-05-14 23:57,23.95,"Dentists must exhibit a high standard of morals and ethics because the public entrusts them with their health care needs. Sometimes, ethics can mean working in a place that is in a sort of gray area that is neither black nor white. This requires one to cultivate a state of mind that provides good judgment, balance, and equilibrium between right and wrong, right and more right, and sometimes the lesser of two evils. The goal of being ethically aware is to act accordingly and appropriately.
      
      The most obvious example of ethics in dentistry is to know when to refer out because of one's limitations and weaknesses in doing certain procedures. This is a balance act since ego can sometimes delude one to have a false sense of confidence, which could further result with clinical disasters and possible law suits. On the other hand, practicing dentistry means to venture slightly out of one's comfort zone in order to grow clinically and to become a better dentist. While the risks and rewards of practicing dentistry must be assessed, it is important to keep the patient's best interest as a top priority.",D1L

I believe the New York experience will allow me to improve my interpersonal skills and to learn how to work with my colleagues, professors, and future patients.

This is especially important in cultivating trust with colleagues and patients. Carrying myself as I normally would as a rowdy, thug-like, manly man does not fly in the professional setting. So I must reinvent myself to become a sophisticated man of class while remembering not to be too uptight and stuck up. Although I am truly proud of my academic achievements and admissions into dental school, I must remain humble and remember that I am blessed to have the opportunity to grow in the city of New York.

      Everyone thinks I want to be a dentist because of sculpture. I'm lucky to already have hand-skills, that's the reason I believed I could get through dental school. It has occurred to me, that another, huge reason I want to be a dentist is because  of how much I've always hated going to the dentist. People who are afraid of dentists (most people) will recognize my empathy, and take comfort. It's hubris, believing I can be a likable thing that nobody likes, nonetheless, I'm in good company.

I think that is the most important, not only in academics, but also in the clinic, and in everything else, in order to become a professional.

Now that I have completed my first year, I have come to realize that although it is important to do well, it is even more important to be ethical and honest. I would personally not cheat outright not necessarily morally superior but because I feel bad for the patients--I would not like to be a patient of a health care provider who cheats, even if it is just a simple quiz.

Obviously people having access to these files will have an advantage over others who do not. But then students who have an late lab or an practical right before an major exam will be put on a disadvantage. One thing I learned during my first year is with the huge number of students in our class it is nearly impossible to create an equal and fair setting for every student. And sometimes this makes it so hard to decide whether some acts are considered cheating or not. It will be a good idea to talk about what specific act will be considered cheating during orientation,D1L

For now, during orientation week, my goal in to be in the top 20% of the class. Hopefully I will be able to achieve this and will be able to aim higher as time passes. At the same time, I do not want to become overly competitive. I would want to learn how to collaborate and able to provide and receive peer assessment.

To be honest as time passes I am no longer eager to get a good grade to satisfy myself. I am leaning towards general dentistry and do not want to be stressed about the grades too much. However, I will continue to do my best in classes to help myself become a competent dentist.",D1L

As my first year is ending I had a chance to look back and reflect. I was too busy keeping up with school work that I completely forgot about the real reason I wanted to become a dentist.

Ethics to me, at this stage is important for growing as student and future clinician. If I do not study and learn the material now, odds are I will not be  learn it later (which is why I can't understand why so many people cheat). I consider myself a pretty honest person and student and cannot believe the hoops we jump through at NYU to take an exam, especially when I have friends in other medical schools who take their exams in a computer lab by themselves at a time of their choice.

It is vital for a dental student to learn these traits now so that they become natural in the future when working with fellow staff, colleagues, and patients. An incompetent, unprofessional dentist will quickly become a unrespected (and possibly unemployed dentist) rather quickly. That being said, for a school that preaches ""professionalism"" and ""competency"" I have been pretty disappointed in many of the things I have seen at NYU - especially amongst the basic sciences. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I study my butt off for exams and quizzes in tough subjects, but no one has the decency to proofread the content (we have repeated questions on probably half of our quizzes). I wish the faculty could be a bit more professional in that aspect.",D1L

We have learned the theory of professionalism and ethics in a class, dressed like professionals in the classroom (if you consider most dentists as scrub wearers), and tried to act like professionals when visiting 3 year old kids at their day cares. Part of begin a professional is learning new scientific material and knowing when to apply it to a clinical setting - I think I am improving immensely in that area of study with the help of some very good professors/ clinicians/ lecturers at NYU.",D1L

Examples and goals include working with New York City community and making an oral health mission trip abroad. My goal is to find my niche within the profession; whether that means to be a general dentist, faculty member, or pursue a specialization, I really do not know at this time.

Squeeze as much information into your head, try to strive for the perfect score on that practical, and never satisfy by becoming the last.

Dr. More constantly stressed the importance of upholding one's ethical values and staying true to his or her beliefs, which I believe to be extremely important.  I think that it is easy to become jaded in this profession, especially if you've done it for a long time.  The care and thought you put into your job may diminish as the years go by.  I'm not saying that this will lead to a decline in quality/level of service you'll provide, or that you'll end up engaging in unethical behavior, but it certainly is a slippery slope.

My study habits have improved for the most part, although my grades have a lot of room for improvement as well.  I'm finding myself with a lot of free time, which is unusual, and have thus been able to partake in a handful of volunteering/outreaches/extracurriculars.  I've also taken up research again, after speaking with my PI who mentored me back when I was a Master's student at NYU, though now I'm part of a different lab.

I want to collaborate and develop deep relationships with my classmates because I will need their help and support during these four years and continued afterwards through the rest of my professional career.  I will also do whatever I can to be there for those around me because we're all in this together.
