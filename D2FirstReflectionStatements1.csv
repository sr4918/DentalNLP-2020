2. As a dentists I should be compassionate and understanding. I would educate my patients with the required information to maintain good heath and motivation them to comply with it.
3. Each patient should get my complete focus. How much ever busy the dental practice is, every patient should feel like they are the primary focus.

Within dentistry, I will openly say that I am alright with sharing notes and workload with didactic knowledge, but I will never forgive anyone who takes shortcuts regarding clinical skills because hand skills can never have shortcuts. They are what they are and the right way has to be practiced. Didactic knowledge simply has to be retained and reflected upon, and the process of getting there is always different.

I am not entirely sure because I am still looking for an ideal role model that embodies 'professionalism.' I think at this stage, I will just continue to observe people to find traits I appreciate and think are successful, so that I can follow suit! I try to be on time and have the best communication, but sometimes I do not know where to draw the line when it comes to asking questions because I do not want a professor to be mad at me for asking too many questions, and I know that I am silly and hurt myself sometimes by keeping quiet instead of asking.",D2F

I've very much enjoyed the lab work. I think I can be pretty critical of my work, however, and this slows me down in lab, often putting me behind on due dates.

1,QGvQF4Ls,Ethic Reflection,05-12-14 22:06,22.1,"Why cheat? Is getting access to previous years exam considered cheating. Obviously people having access to these files will have an advantage over others who do not. But then students who have an late lab or an practical right before an major exam will be put on a disadvantage. One thing I learned during my first year is with the huge number of students in our class it is nearly impossible to create an equal and fair setting for every student. And sometimes this makes it so hard to decide whether some acts are considered cheating or not. It will be a good idea to talk about what specific act will be considered cheating during orientation
Sometimes we get emails from professors that they have observed cheating going on and are disappointed. They also say there will be punishment next time and don't expect us to be cheating. This makes absolutely no sense. I just laugh when I get these types of email. Why not punish the act in the first time. If they let go of cheating the first time, wouldn't it be fair to let others cheat at least once? For sure, it won't be fair for somebody to get caught cheating because they were ""warned"" while the person who cheated in the very beginning will just get off with a warning. I'm not even sure if nyucd is really that concerned about cheating going on in this school",D2F

For now, during orientation week, my goal in to be in the top 20% of the class. Hopefully I will be able to achieve this and will be able to aim higher as time passes. At the same time, I do not want to become overly competitive. I would want to learn how to collaborate and able to provide and receive peer assessment.

To be honest as time passes I am no longer eager to get a good grade to satisfy myself. I am leaning towards general dentistry and do not want to be stressed about the grades too much. However, I will continue to do my best in classes to help myself become a competent dentist.

I will try to get involved in more community service during this summer and my D2 years

Almost half way through D2, we are doing more lab work that is related to dentistry. Being exposed to different types of dentistry was a good experience for me.
